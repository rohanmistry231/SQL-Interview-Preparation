## 🎯 Why Giant Projects Matter for AI/ML Interviews

Giant Projects are a **must-have** for AI/ML roles, and here’s why:

1. **Roadmap Mastery**: Integrate *DQL*, *DML*, *DDL*, *Joins*, *DateTime Functions*, and more into cohesive solutions.
2. **Interview Edge**: Demonstrate end-to-end SQL skills—20% of FAANG interviews test multi-step data workflows like these.
3. **Real-World Impact**: Mirror industry tasks, like preprocessing ML datasets or reporting model trends.
4. **Portfolio Power**: Create tangible outputs (CSVs, reports) to wow recruiters on `irohanportfolio.netlify.app`.
5. **Problem-Solving**: Show you can break down complex ML problems into clear SQL steps.

Mastering these projects proves you’re ready to handle production-level data challenges, making you a standout candidate! 🌟

## 🚀 How to Use This Giant Projects Section

1. **Pick a Project**: Start with Project 1 for pipeline basics or jump to Project 2 for time-series fun.
2. **Set Up**: Use a database (PostgreSQL, MySQL) with sample tables like `predictions` or `models`.
3. **Dive In**: Follow each sub-folder’s README for problem details, tasks, and solutions.
4. **Build & Test**: Code queries, validate with `EXPLAIN`, and generate outputs (e.g., CSVs).
5. **Showcase**: Document your work in `irohanportfolio.netlify.app` with a README explaining the ML context.

> **Pro Tip**: Spend 4-6 hours per project, breaking tasks into chunks (e.g., schema first, then queries). Add visualizations with Python’s `matplotlib` for extra portfolio flair!

## 💼 Portfolio Tips

- **Export Results**: Save query outputs as CSVs (e.g., trend reports, model metrics) for tangible artifacts.
- **Write READMEs**: For each project, explain the problem, your SQL solution, and its ML impact.
- **Highlight Skills**: Tag projects with roadmap topics (e.g., *DQL*, *DateTime Functions*) to show versatility.
- **Visualize**: Use Python’s `pandas` or `seaborn` to plot results, boosting `irohanportfolio.netlify.app`.
- **Share**: Post your projects on GitHub and link them in your resume for recruiter cred.
