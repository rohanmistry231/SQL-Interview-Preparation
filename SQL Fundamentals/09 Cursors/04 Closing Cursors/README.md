# üîÑ Closing Cursors - Releasing Resources

## üåü Overview

**Closing Cursors** deactivates an open cursor, **releasing its resources** and ending its ability to fetch data. This step is critical for freeing memory and avoiding database locks, ensuring efficient resource management.

In AI/ML, closing cursors is essential for **clean pipeline execution**, like finalizing `training_data` processing. For freshers, it‚Äôs a **supporting interview topic**, often tested in questions about resource management and stored procedure best practices.

## üìú Syntax

```sql
-- Generic SQL (varies by database)
CLOSE cursor_name;
```

- **Basic Example** (SQL Server syntax):
  ```sql
  DECLARE prediction_cursor CURSOR FOR
      SELECT model_id FROM predictions;
  OPEN prediction_cursor;
  -- Fetch logic here
  CLOSE prediction_cursor;
  ```
- **In Procedure** (Oracle-style):
  ```sql
  DECLARE
      CURSOR training_cursor IS SELECT feature1 FROM training_data;
  BEGIN
      OPEN training_cursor;
      -- Fetch logic
      CLOSE training_cursor;
  END;
  ```

## üí° Use Cases in AI/ML

- **Pipeline Cleanup**: Close `prediction_cursor` after processing `predictions`.
- **Resource Freeing**: Release `training_cursor` post-feature engineering.
- **Log Processing**: Close `log_cursor` after analyzing `logs`.
- **Experiment Wrap-Up**: Finalize `result_cursor` after metrics calculation.
- **Migration Completion**: Close `legacy_cursor` after data reformatting.

## üîë Key Features

- **Resource Release**: Frees memory and locks held by the cursor.
- **Single Command**: Simple syntax with no parameters.
- **Post-Fetch**: Used after all fetching is complete.
- **Safe Closure**: Prevents further fetching attempts.

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- **Always Close**: Close cursors immediately after fetching.
- **Check State**: Ensure cursor is open before closing.
- **Deallocate**: Use `DEALLOCATE` (where required) to fully remove cursors.
- **Test Cleanup**: Verify closure in a sandbox to confirm resource release.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

- **Unclosed Cursors**: Leaving cursors open wastes resources.
- **Closed Cursor Errors**: Fetching after `CLOSE` causes failures.
- **Syntax Variance**: Closure syntax differs slightly by database.
- **Missing Deallocation**: Forgetting `DEALLOCATE` (e.g., SQL Server) retains cursor.

## üìù Additional Notes

- **Database Variations**:
  - **MySQL**: Uses `CLOSE cursor_name` in stored procedures.
  - **PostgreSQL**: Supports `CLOSE cursor_name`; tied to transactions.
  - **SQL Server**: Uses `CLOSE` and `DEALLOCATE` for full cleanup.
  - **Oracle**: Uses `CLOSE cursor_name` in PL/SQL blocks.
- **Deallocation**: SQL Server requires `DEALLOCATE` to remove cursor definition.
- **Transactions**: Closing cursors may depend on transaction state in some databases.
