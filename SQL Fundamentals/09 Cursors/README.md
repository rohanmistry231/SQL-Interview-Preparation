## 🌟 What are Cursors?

**Cursors** in SQL are database objects that allow **row-by-row processing** of query results, enabling fine-grained control over data iteration within stored procedures or scripts. Unlike set-based operations, cursors are used for sequential access, making them ideal for complex logic that requires individual row manipulation.

In AI/ML, cursors are useful for **iterating through datasets**, such as processing `training_data` rows for feature calculations or logging model outputs. For freshers, they’re a **niche but critical interview topic**, often tested in questions about advanced SQL, stored procedure logic, and data pipeline customization! 💡

## 🎯 Why Cursors Matter for AI/ML Interviews

Cursors are a **valuable skill** for AI/ML roles because:

1. **Data Processing**: Iterate over `predictions` for custom transformations.
2. **Interview Edge**: Questions may involve cursors for row-level logic in procedures.
3. **Pipeline Customization**: Process `training_data` rows for ML preprocessing.
4. **Debugging**: Step through `logs` to analyze pipeline issues.
5. **Database Support**: Widely used in PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, and (with limits) MySQL.

Mastering cursors will help you tackle advanced SQL challenges and stand out in technical interviews! 🌟

## 🚀 How to Use This Cursors Section

1. **Start with Declaring Cursors**: Learn to define cursors, the first step in iteration.
2. **Progress to Opening Cursors**: Understand how to activate cursors for use.
3. **Dive into Fetching Data**: Master retrieving rows for processing.
4. **Finish with Closing Cursors**: Learn to clean up cursors properly.
5. **Folder Breakdown**: Each sub-folder contains:
   - **README.md**: Detailed theory and best practices.
   - **Coding**: Hands-on SQL queries to practice.
   - **Interview_Exercises**: Curated problems to ace interviews.
6. **Practice Regularly**: Spend 1-2 hours per sub-folder, experimenting with cursors.
7. **Focus on Interview Hits**: `Declaring Cursors` and `Fetching Data` are key for interview prep!

> **Pro Tip**: Use cursors sparingly and test in a sandbox—interviewers love candidates who balance row-based and set-based approaches for efficiency!

## 💡 Cursors in AI/ML: Real-World Use Cases

Cursors power AI/ML workflows:

- **Feature Engineering**: Iterate `training_data` to compute per-row metrics.
- **Model Validation**: Process `predictions` row-by-row for error checks.
- **Pipeline Logging**: Log `staging_table` rows to `audit_logs` individually.
- **Experiment Analysis**: Step through `results` for custom aggregations.
- **Data Migration**: Transform `legacy_data` rows for ML-ready formats.

Cursors give you precise control for advanced data tasks! 🌍

## 📚 Tips for Success

- **Start Simple**: Practice basic cursors before complex loops.
- **Use Sandbox**: Test cursor logic in a non-production database.
- **Practice Platforms**: Try LeetCode, HackerRank, or SQLZoo for cursor challenges.
- **Avoid Overuse**: Prefer set-based queries for performance where possible.
- **Document Code**: Comment cursor logic for clarity and maintenance.
