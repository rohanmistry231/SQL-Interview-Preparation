# 🎉 Master Delete with Conditions - Clean Your ML Data Like a Pro!

## 🌟 Welcome

**Delete with Conditions** uses `WHERE` to remove specific rows, perfect for pruning bad ML predictions or outdated records. It’s your tool for targeted data cleanup. This guide will walk you through learning conditional `DELETE` with ML-themed examples, powering up your *ML-Interview-Preparation-Hub*! 🚀

## 🛤️ Learning Path

1. **Understand Targeting**: Learn how `WHERE` pinpoints rows to delete.
2. **Study the Syntax**: See `DELETE` with `WHERE` clauses.
3. **Run Examples**: Try the queries below in a database like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
4. **Test Conditions**: Experiment with different `WHERE` clauses to refine deletions.
5. **Apply to ML**: Use conditional deletes to remove invalid ML data for better models.

## 📜 Syntax

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

- **Example 1: Remove Low Scores**:
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM predictions
  WHERE score < 0.5;
  ```
  *Deletes predictions with low `score`s, like removing weak ML results.*

- **Example 2: Clear Old Predictions**:
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM predictions
  WHERE prediction_date < '2025-01-01';
  ```
  *Removes outdated predictions, great for refreshing ML datasets.*

- **Example 3: Delete by Model**:
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM predictions
  WHERE model_id = 101 AND model_name = 'OldModel';
  ```
  *Erases specific model’s data, useful for ML experiment cleanup.*

## 💡 Practice Tips

- **Tool Up**: Use [SQLFiddle](http://sqlfiddle.com) or a local DB to test deletes.
- **ML Use Case**: Conditional deletes help clean ML datasets by removing outliers or obsolete records, improving model accuracy.
- **Try This**: Create `predictions` with 10 rows, delete where `score < 0.6`, then verify with `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM predictions`.
- **Debug**: Test `WHERE` with `SELECT` first—wrong conditions can delete too much! Always backup data in production.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- **Deepen Skills**: Explore `Delete All Rows` for full table resets or combine with `UPDATE` for data fixes before deletion.
- **Portfolio Boost**: Add a conditional delete query to `irohanportfolio.netlify.app`, explaining its ML data cleanup role.
- **Challenge**: Delete predictions older than 2025-03-01 for a portfolio ML dataset.
