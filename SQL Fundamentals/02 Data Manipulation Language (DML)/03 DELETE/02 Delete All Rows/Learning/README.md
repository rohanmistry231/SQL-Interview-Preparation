# üéâ Master Delete All Rows - Reset Your ML Data with Ease!

## üåü Welcome

**Delete All Rows** wipes every row from a table without dropping it, ideal for resetting ML datasets or clearing test data. It‚Äôs your quick way to start fresh. This guide will teach you how to learn `DELETE` for all rows with ML examples, leveling up your *ML-Interview-Preparation-Hub*! üöÄ

## üõ§Ô∏è Learning Path

1. **Get the Concept**: Understand how `DELETE` without `WHERE` clears all rows.
2. **Learn Syntax**: Study the simple `DELETE` or `TRUNCATE` options.
3. **Run Examples**: Try the queries below in a database like MySQL.
4. **Verify Results**: Check table emptiness after deletion.
5. **ML Spin**: Use full deletes to reset ML experiment tables or prep for new data.

## üìú Syntax

```sql
-- Basic Delete
DELETE FROM table_name;

-- Alternative: Truncate (faster, no transaction log)
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
```

- **Example 1: Clear Predictions**:
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM predictions;
  ```
  *Removes all rows from `predictions`, like resetting an ML dataset.*

- **Example 2: Truncate Table**:
  ```sql
  TRUNCATE TABLE predictions;
  ```
  *Wipes `predictions` instantly, great for clearing ML test data.*

- **Example 3: Delete with Count Check**:
  ```sql
  -- Check rows first
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM predictions;
  -- Then delete
  DELETE FROM predictions;
  ```
  *Verifies row count before clearing, useful for ML data management.*

## üí° Practice Tips

- **Tool Time**: Practice on [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com) or PostgreSQL.
- **ML Use Case**: Full deletes reset ML tables for new experiments or clean up after model testing.
- **Try This**: Add 5 rows to `predictions`, run `DELETE`, then confirm with `SELECT * FROM predictions` (should be empty).
- **Note**: `DELETE` is reversible with transactions; `TRUNCATE` is faster but permanent‚Äîtest in a sandbox! Use `SELECT COUNT(*)` to confirm before deleting.

## üöÄ Next Steps

- **Level Up**: Try `Delete with Conditions` for selective cleanup or `INSERT` to repopulate tables.
- **Portfolio Win**: Add a full delete query to `irohanportfolio.netlify.app`, showing ML dataset reset.
- **Challenge**: Clear `predictions` and reinsert 3 rows for a portfolio ML dataset.
