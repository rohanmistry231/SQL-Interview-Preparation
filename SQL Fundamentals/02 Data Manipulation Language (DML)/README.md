## üåü What is DML?

**Data Manipulation Language (DML)** is the subset of SQL used to **modify data** within a database. Unlike DQL (which retrieves data), DML focuses on adding (`INSERT`), modifying (`UPDATE`), and removing (`DELETE`) records. These operations are critical for maintaining and preparing datasets, ensuring data integrity, and supporting dynamic AI/ML workflows.

In AI/ML, DML is essential for tasks like populating training datasets, updating model metadata, or cleaning outdated records. For freshers, DML is a **core interview topic**, often tested in coding challenges and scenario-based questions about data management! üí°

## üéØ Why DML Matters for AI/ML Interviews

DML is a **must-have skill** for AI/ML roles because:

1. **Data Preparation**: DML enables you to build and refine datasets for model training.
2. **Interview Essentials**: Questions frequently involve writing `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statements to manipulate data.
3. **Data Integrity**: Ensures accurate updates and deletions, critical for reliable ML pipelines.
4. **Real-World Impact**: Supports ETL processes, data versioning, and database maintenance.
5. **Universal Applicability**: Works across MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and more.

Mastering DML will empower you to handle data manipulation tasks confidently and ace technical interviews! üåü

## üó∫Ô∏è DML Roadmap

Our DML journey is structured into **leaf nodes**, each focusing on a key manipulation operation. Click the links below to explore in-depth theory, coding examples, and interview exercises for each topic! üìö

| Leaf Node | Description | Folder Link |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **INSERT** | Add new records to a table, populating databases with fresh data. | [üìÇ 01 INSERT](./01%20INSERT) |
| **UPDATE** | Modify existing records based on conditions, ensuring data accuracy. | [üìÇ 02 UPDATE](./02%20UPDATE) |
| **DELETE** | Remove records from a table, cleaning up unwanted data. | [üìÇ 03 DELETE](./03%20DELETE) |

## üöÄ How to Use This DML Section

1. **Start with INSERT**: Learn to add data, the foundation of populating databases.
2. **Progress to UPDATE and DELETE**: Master modifying and removing data for full control.
3. **Explore Each Folder**: Every leaf node folder contains:
   - **README.md**: Detailed theory and best practices.
   - **Coding**: Hands-on SQL queries to practice.
   - **Interview_Exercises**: Curated problems to ace interviews.
4. **Practice Regularly**: Spend 1-2 hours per leaf node, experimenting with data changes.
5. **Focus on Interview Favorites**: `INSERT` and `UPDATE` are common in fresher interviews, so prioritize them!

> **Pro Tip**: Always test DML statements with a `SELECT` query first to preview affected rows‚Äîinterviewers value caution and accuracy!

## üí° DML in AI/ML: Real-World Use Cases

DML powers critical AI/ML workflows:

- **Dataset Creation**: Use `INSERT` to populate tables with training data (e.g., `INSERT INTO training_data SELECT * FROM raw_data WHERE valid = 1`).
- **Data Correction**: Apply `UPDATE` to fix errors (e.g., `UPDATE customers SET email = 'corrected@domain.com' WHERE email IS NULL`).
- **Data Cleanup**: Leverage `DELETE` to remove outliers (e.g., `DELETE FROM predictions WHERE score < 0.1`).
- **Model Metadata**: Update model performance metrics (e.g., `UPDATE models SET accuracy = 0.95 WHERE model_id = 1`).
- **ETL Pipelines**: Combine DML operations to transform and load data for analysis.

DML ensures your data is ready for machine learning models and production systems! üåç

## üìö Tips for Success

- **Start Simple**: Practice basic `INSERT` statements before tackling complex `UPDATE` or `DELETE`.
- **Use Transactions**: Wrap DML in transactions (`BEGIN`/`COMMIT`) to ensure safe changes.
- **Test Changes**: Preview modifications with `SELECT` to avoid mistakes.
- **Practice Platforms**: Try LeetCode, HackerRank, or SQLZoo for DML challenges.
- **Understand Constraints**: Learn how primary keys, foreign keys, and triggers affect DML.
