## ðŸ“š Interview Questions by Concept

Below, each concept has 1-2 tricky questions with ML-relevant scenarios, schemas, and solutions. Get ready to grant like a pro!

### 1. Grant Permissions
- **Description**: `GRANT` assigns specific privileges (e.g., SELECT, INSERT) to users on database objects.
- **Interview Focus**: Tests precision in privilege assignment and object targeting.

#### Question 1.1: Analyst Data Access
- **Problem**: Your ML teamâ€™s analyst needs to query predictions. Write a query to grant `SELECT` permission on the `predictions` table to the user `ml_analyst`.
- **Trick**: Tests if you assign only the required privilege without over-privileging.
- **AI/ML Use Case**: Enables analysts to view model outputs securely.
- **Solution (Answer)**:
  <details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  ```sql
  GRANT SELECT ON predictions TO ml_analyst;
  ```
  </details>

#### Question 1.2: Developer Write Access
- **Problem**: An ML developer needs to update model metadata. Write a query to grant `SELECT`, `INSERT`, and `UPDATE` permissions on the `models` table to the user `ml_developer`.
- **Trick**: Ensures you grant multiple privileges correctly for a single object.
- **AI/ML Use Case**: Allows developers to manage model records.
- **Solution (Answer)**:
  <details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  ```sql
  GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON models TO ml_developer;
  ```
  </details>

### 2. Grant Roles
- **Description**: `GRANT` assigns roles to users, bundling privileges for easier management.
- **Interview Focus**: Tests role-based access control and hierarchy understanding.

#### Question 2.1: Assign Analyst Role
- **Problem**: Your ML pipeline uses a role for analysts. Write a query to grant the `analyst_role` to the user `ml_analyst`, assuming `analyst_role` has `SELECT` on `predictions` and `models`.
- **Trick**: Tests if you understand role assignment without needing to redefine privileges.
- **AI/ML Use Case**: Streamlines access for the analytics team.
- **Solution (Answer)**:
  <details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  ```sql
  GRANT analyst_role TO ml_analyst;
  ```
  </details>

#### Question 2.2: Admin Role for Team Lead
- **Problem**: The ML team lead needs full control. Write a query to grant the `admin_role` to the user `ml_lead`, assuming `admin_role` has `ALL PRIVILEGES` on `predictions`, `models`, and `event_logs`.
- **Trick**: Ensures you assign a powerful role carefully, understanding its scope.
- **AI/ML Use Case**: Empowers the lead to manage all pipeline data.
- **Solution (Answer)**:
  <details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  ```sql
  GRANT admin_role TO ml_lead;
  ```
  </details>

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Success

- **Start Simple**: Begin with `Grant Permissions` to nail specific privileges.
- **Watch for Traps**: Interviewers test over-privileging in `Grant Permissions` and role scope in `Grant Roles`.
- **Explain Clearly**: Practice justifying permission choices (e.g., least privilege principle) for whiteboard rounds.
- **Test Thoroughly**: Run queries in MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server with the setups below.
- **Optimize Access**: Use roles for teams to simplify management; avoid blanket `ALL PRIVILEGES`.
- **Portfolio Power**: Save solutions to your GitHub to show recruiters your SQL skills.

## ðŸ“‚ Schema & Database Details

To tackle these questions, set up the following tables, users, and roles in your database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server). Each question tests GRANT operations, so youâ€™ll assign permissions or roles to users. Below are schemas, user setups, and sample dataâ€”copy-paste to test queries or save as `.sql` files.

### Schema 1: predictions
- **Used In**: Grant Permissions, Grant Roles
- **Description**: Stores ML predictions.
- **Schema**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE predictions (
      prediction_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      model_id INT,
      score FLOAT,
      prediction_date DATE
  );
  ```
- **Sample Data** (5 rows):
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO predictions (prediction_id, model_id, score, prediction_date) VALUES
  (1, 101, 0.92, '2025-08-15'),
  (2, 101, 0.87, '2025-08-16'),
  (3, 102, 0.95, '2025-08-17'),
  (4, 102, 0.78, '2025-08-18'),
  (5, 103, 0.91, '2025-08-19');
  ```

### Schema 2: models
- **Used In**: Grant Permissions, Grant Roles
- **Description**: Stores ML model metadata.
- **Schema**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE models (
      model_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      model_name VARCHAR(100),
      created_date DATE
  );
  ```
- **Sample Data** (3 rows):
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO models (model_id, model_name, created_date) VALUES
  (101, 'Model A', '2025-08-01'),
  (102, 'Model B', '2025-08-02'),
  (103, 'Model C', '2025-08-03');
  ```

### Schema 3: event_logs
- **Used In**: Grant Roles
- **Description**: Logs ML pipeline events.
- **Schema**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE event_logs (
      log_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      event_type VARCHAR(50),
      status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Pending'
  );
  ```
- **Sample Data** (3 rows):
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO event_logs (log_id, event_type, status) VALUES
  (1, 'Training Start', 'Completed'),
  (2, 'Validation', 'Failed'),
  (3, 'Prediction Run', 'Completed');
  ```

### User and Role Setup
- **Users**:
  ```sql
  CREATE USER 'ml_analyst'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'securepass';
  CREATE USER 'ml_developer'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'devpass';
  CREATE USER 'ml_lead'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'leadpass';
  ```
- **Roles**:
  ```sql
  CREATE ROLE analyst_role;
  CREATE ROLE admin_role;
  GRANT SELECT ON predictions TO analyst_role;
  GRANT SELECT ON models TO analyst_role;
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON predictions TO admin_role;
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON models TO admin_role;
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON event_logs TO admin_role;
  ```

### Setup Instructions
1. **Create Tables and Data**: Run the `CREATE TABLE` and `INSERT` statements above.
2. **Set Up Users and Roles**: Execute the user and role creation queries.
3. **Test Queries**: Use a sandbox (MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, SQL Server Management Studio) to run GRANT operations.
4. **Compatibility**:
   - MySQL: Supports `GRANT` for permissions; roles require MySQL 8.0+.
   - PostgreSQL: Fully supports roles and permissions; use `GRANT` similarly.
   - SQL Server: Uses `GRANT` for permissions; roles are `DATABASE ROLE`.
5. **Verify Permissions**: Test access (e.g., `SELECT * FROM predictions` as `ml_analyst`) after granting.
6. **Data Scale**: Sample data is small for testing; scale to 100 rows by repeating patterns if needed.
