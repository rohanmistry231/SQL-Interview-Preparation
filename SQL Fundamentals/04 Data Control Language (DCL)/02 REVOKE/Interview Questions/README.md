## ðŸ“š Interview Questions by Concept

Below, each concept has 1-2 tricky questions with ML-relevant scenarios, schemas, and solutions. Get ready to revoke like a pro!

### 1. Revoke Permissions
- **Description**: `REVOKE` removes specific privileges (e.g., SELECT, INSERT) from users on database objects.
- **Interview Focus**: Tests precision in privilege removal and object targeting.

#### Question 1.1: Restrict Analyst Access
- **Problem**: An analyst no longer needs to query predictions. Write a query to revoke `SELECT` permission on the `predictions` table from the user `ml_analyst`.
- **Trick**: Tests if you remove only the specified privilege without affecting others.
- **AI/ML Use Case**: Limits access to model outputs for security.
- **Solution (Answer)**:
  <details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  ```sql
  REVOKE SELECT ON predictions FROM ml_analyst;
  ```
  </details>

#### Question 1.2: Limit Developer Privileges
- **Problem**: A developerâ€™s role has changed. Write a query to revoke `INSERT` and `UPDATE` permissions on the `models` table from the user `ml_developer`, leaving `SELECT` intact.
- **Trick**: Ensures you revoke multiple privileges selectively without over-restricting.
- **AI/ML Use Case**: Reduces write access to model metadata after a project phase.
- **Solution (Answer)**:
  <details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  ```sql
  REVOKE INSERT, UPDATE ON models FROM ml_developer;
  ```
  </details>

### 2. Revoke Roles
- **Description**: `REVOKE` removes roles from users, stripping associated privileges.
- **Interview Focus**: Tests role-based access control and hierarchy management.

#### Question 2.1: Remove Analyst Role
- **Problem**: An analyst has left the ML team. Write a query to revoke the `analyst_role` from the user `ml_analyst`, where `analyst_role` includes `SELECT` on `predictions` and `models`.
- **Trick**: Tests if you understand role revocation and its impact on privileges.
- **AI/ML Use Case**: Cleans up access for departed team members.
- **Solution (Answer)**:
  <details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  ```sql
  REVOKE analyst_role FROM ml_analyst;
  ```
  </details>

#### Question 2.2: Demote Team Lead
- **Problem**: The ML team leadâ€™s admin privileges are being downgraded. Write a query to revoke the `admin_role` from the user `ml_lead`, where `admin_role` has `ALL PRIVILEGES` on `predictions`, `models`, and `event_logs`.
- **Trick**: Ensures you revoke a powerful role carefully, considering its broad scope.
- **AI/ML Use Case**: Adjusts access for role reassignment in the pipeline.
- **Solution (Answer)**:
  <details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  ```sql
  REVOKE admin_role FROM ml_lead;
  ```
  </details>

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Success

- **Start Precise**: Begin with `Revoke Permissions` to master selective access removal.
- **Watch for Traps**: Interviewers test over-revoking in `Revoke Permissions` and role dependency issues in `Revoke Roles`.
- **Explain Clearly**: Practice justifying revocation reasons (e.g., security compliance) for whiteboard rounds.
- **Test Thoroughly**: Run queries in MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server with the setups below.
- **Secure Access**: Verify revoked permissions to ensure minimal privilege principles.
- **Portfolio Power**: Save solutions to your GitHub to show recruiters your SQL skills.

## ðŸ“‚ Schema & Database Details

To tackle these questions, set up the following tables, users, and roles in your database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server). Each question tests REVOKE operations, so youâ€™ll remove permissions or roles from users. Below are schemas, user setups, and sample dataâ€”copy-paste to test queries or save as `.sql` files.

### Schema 1: predictions
- **Used In**: Revoke Permissions, Revoke Roles
- **Description**: Stores ML predictions.
- **Schema**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE predictions (
      prediction_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      model_id INT,
      score FLOAT,
      prediction_date DATE
  );
  ```
- **Sample Data** (5 rows):
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO predictions (prediction_id, model_id, score, prediction_date) VALUES
  (1, 101, 0.92, '2025-08-15'),
  (2, 101, 0.87, '2025-08-16'),
  (3, 102, 0.95, '2025-08-17'),
  (4, 102, 0.78, '2025-08-18'),
  (5, 103, 0.91, '2025-08-19');
  ```

### Schema 2: models
- **Used In**: Revoke Permissions, Revoke Roles
- **Description**: Stores ML model metadata.
- **Schema**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE models (
      model_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      model_name VARCHAR(100),
      created_date DATE
  );
  ```
- **Sample Data** (3 rows):
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO models (model_id, model_name, created_date) VALUES
  (101, 'Model A', '2025-08-01'),
  (102, 'Model B', '2025-08-02'),
  (103, 'Model C', '2025-08-03');
  ```

### Schema 3: event_logs
- **Used In**: Revoke Roles
- **Description**: Logs ML pipeline events.
- **Schema**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE event_logs (
      log_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      event_type VARCHAR(50),
      status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Pending'
  );
  ```
- **Sample Data** (3 rows):
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO event_logs (log_id, event_type, status) VALUES
  (1, 'Training Start', 'Completed'),
  (2, 'Validation', 'Failed'),
  (3, 'Prediction Run', 'Completed');
  ```

### User and Role Setup
- **Users**:
  ```sql
  CREATE USER 'ml_analyst'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'securepass';
  CREATE USER 'ml_developer'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'devpass';
  CREATE USER 'ml_lead'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'leadpass';
  ```
- **Roles and Initial Grants**:
  ```sql
  CREATE ROLE analyst_role;
  CREATE ROLE admin_role;
  GRANT SELECT ON predictions TO analyst_role;
  GRANT SELECT ON models TO analyst_role;
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON predictions TO admin_role;
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON models TO admin_role;
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON event_logs TO admin_role;
  GRANT analyst_role TO ml_analyst;
  GRANT admin_role TO ml_lead;
  GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON models TO ml_developer;
  GRANT SELECT ON predictions TO ml_analyst;
  ```

### Setup Instructions
1. **Create Tables and Data**: Run the `CREATE TABLE` and `INSERT` statements above.
2. **Set Up Users and Roles**: Execute the user, role, and GRANT queries to establish initial permissions.
3. **Test Queries**: Use a sandbox (MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, SQL Server Management Studio) to run REVOKE operations.
4. **Compatibility**:
   - MySQL: Supports `REVOKE` for permissions; roles require MySQL 8.0+.
   - PostgreSQL: Fully supports roles and permissions; use `REVOKE` similarly.
   - SQL Server: Uses `REVOKE` for permissions; roles are `DATABASE ROLE`.
5. **Verify Revocation**: Test access (e.g., attempt `SELECT * FROM predictions` as `ml_analyst`) after revoking.
6. **Data Scale**: Sample data is small for testing; scale to 100 rows by repeating patterns if needed.
