# 🛠️ Pivot Queries Projects - Build ML Data Transformations

## 🌟 Overview

**Pivot Queries** are your ticket to transforming messy ML data into clean, actionable insights! By turning rows into columns, `PIVOT` (or `CASE` statements) makes model metrics and features shine for analytics and dashboards. These projects will help you create portfolio-worthy outputs like pivoted reports, perfect for showing off your AI/ML skills to recruiters. Let’s reshape some data and make your *ML-Interview-Preparation-Hub* pop! 🚀

## 📈 Projects

### Project 1: Model Score Pivot Table
- **Description**: Create a pivoted table to compare average prediction scores across models, ideal for ML model evaluation.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Use the `predictions` table (`prediction_id INT, model_id INT, score FLOAT, prediction_date DATE`).
  2. Write a query to pivot average `score` for `model_id` 101 and 102 by `prediction_date`.
  3. For MySQL, use `CASE` statements to mimic `PIVOT`.
  4. Export the result to a CSV for visualization (e.g., in Python or Excel).
  5. Add a README to your portfolio explaining the query and its ML use case.
- **Expected Outcome**: A table with `prediction_date`, `model_101`, and `model_102` columns showing average scores, ready for your portfolio.
- **Challenge Level**: Beginner

### Project 2: Feature Category Dashboard
- **Description**: Build a pivoted dashboard to summarize feature values by category, streamlining ML feature analysis.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Use the `features` table (`feature_id INT, user_id INT, model_id INT, feature FLOAT, category VARCHAR`).
  2. Pivot average `feature` values for categories `age` and `income` by `user_id`.
  3. Write a dynamic pivot query (SQL Server) to handle new categories automatically.
  4. Save results to a temporary table for dashboard integration.
  5. Document the project in your portfolio with query code and a sample dashboard screenshot.
- **Expected Outcome**: A pivoted dataset with `user_id`, `age`, and `income` columns, plus a dynamic version for scalability, boosting your portfolio.
- **Challenge Level**: Intermediate

## 🚀 How to Use These Projects

1. **Pick a Project**: Start with the Beginner project for quick wins or dive into Intermediate for a challenge.
2. **Set Up**: Use a local DB (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server) with the sample tables.
3. **Code & Test**: Write the queries, test with `EXPLAIN` for performance, and verify outputs.
4. **Showcase**: Export results (e.g., CSV, screenshot) and add a README to your portfolio on `irohanportfolio.netlify.app`, explaining the ML context.
5. **Iterate**: Tweak projects (e.g., add models, new categories) to make them your own!

> **Pro Tip**: Combine with Python (e.g., pandas for visualization) to make your portfolio stand out to ML recruiters!
