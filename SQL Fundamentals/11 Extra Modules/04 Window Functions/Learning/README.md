# üéâ Master Window Functions - Rank Your ML Data Like a Star!

## üåü Welcome

**Window Functions** perform calculations across rows without grouping, perfect for ranking ML predictions or computing running totals. They‚Äôre your key to advanced analytics. This guide will teach you window functions with ML examples, supercharging your *ML-Interview-Preparation-Hub*! üöÄ

## üõ§Ô∏è Learning Path

1. **Understand Windows**: Learn how window functions operate over partitions.
2. **Study Syntax**: See `OVER`, `PARTITION BY`, and `ORDER BY`.
3. **Run Examples**: Try the queries below in a database like PostgreSQL.
4. **Test Rankings**: Verify function outputs (e.g., ranks, totals).
5. **ML Spin**: Use window functions for ML model comparisons.

## üìú Syntax

```sql
SELECT column,
       function() OVER (PARTITION BY column ORDER BY column) AS alias
FROM table_name;
```

- **Example 1: Rank Predictions**:
  ```sql
  SELECT model_id, score,
         RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY model_id ORDER BY score DESC) AS score_rank
  FROM predictions;
  ```
  *Ranks ML predictions by score per model.*

- **Example 2: Running Accuracy Total**:
  ```sql
  SELECT model_id, accuracy,
         SUM(accuracy) OVER (PARTITION BY model_id ORDER BY eval_date) AS running_total
  FROM model_metrics;
  ```
  *Calculates cumulative ML model accuracy.*

- **Example 3: Top Score Flag**:
  ```sql
  SELECT prediction_id, score,
         CASE WHEN ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY model_id ORDER BY score DESC) = 1 THEN 'Top'
              ELSE 'Other' END AS top_score
  FROM predictions;
  ```
  *Flags top ML prediction scores per model.*

## üí° Practice Tips

- **Tool Time**: Use [SQLFiddle](http://sqlfiddle.com) or PostgreSQL for window functions.
- **ML Use Case**: Window functions rank ML models or track performance trends.
- **Try This**: Run the rank example, check top ranks, and compare with `ORDER BY`.
- **Note**: Use `DENSE_RANK()` for no gaps in rankings‚Äîtest both to see the difference.

## üöÄ Next Steps

- **Level Up**: Try `Common Table Expressions` for query clarity or `Pivot Queries` for reshaping.
- **Portfolio Win**: Add a window function to `irohanportfolio.netlify.app`, showing ML rankings.
- **Challenge**: Rank ML predictions by score in a portfolio dataset.

Rank like a pro, and let‚Äôs rock your SQL game! üåü
