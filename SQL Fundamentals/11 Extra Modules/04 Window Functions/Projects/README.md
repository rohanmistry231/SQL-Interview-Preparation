## 📈 Projects

### Project 1: Model Leaderboard Generator
- **Description**: Build a leaderboard ranking predictions by score per model, perfect for ML evaluation.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Use the `predictions` table (`prediction_id INT, model_id INT, score FLOAT, prediction_date DATE`).
  2. Write a query using `RANK()` to rank predictions within each `model_id` by `score`.
  3. Test with `DENSE_RANK()` and compare outputs.
  4. Export the leaderboard to a CSV for visualization.
  5. Add to your portfolio with a README explaining the query and ML context.
- **Expected Outcome**: A ranked leaderboard table, ready for your portfolio.
- **Challenge Level**: Beginner

### Project 2: Time-Series Trend Analyzer
- **Description**: Create a report tracking score trends over time for models, showcasing ML performance analysis.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Use the `predictions` table.
  2. Write a query with `LAG()` to compute score deltas and `AVG()` for running averages per `model_id`, ordered by `prediction_date`.
  3. Use `ROWS BETWEEN` for a cumulative window.
  4. Save results to a temporary table for dashboard integration.
  5. Document in your portfolio with code, sample trends, and ML use case.
- **Expected Outcome**: A trend report with deltas and averages, boosting your portfolio’s analytics cred.
- **Challenge Level**: Intermediate

## 🚀 How to Use These Projects

1. **Pick a Project**: Start with Beginner for quick wins or dive into Intermediate for analytics flair.
2. **Set Up**: Use a DB (PostgreSQL, MySQL 8.0+, SQL Server) with the sample tables.
3. **Code & Test**: Write queries, optimize with `EXPLAIN`, and verify rankings or trends.
4. **Showcase**: Export results (e.g., CSV, screenshot) and add a README to `irohanportfolio.netlify.app` with ML insights.
5. **Customize**: Add partitions or functions to make projects your own!

> **Pro Tip**: Visualize trends with Python’s matplotlib for a portfolio that wows ML recruiters!
