# 🛠️ Specialized Queries Projects - Advanced ML Data Tools

## 🌟 Overview

**Specialized Queries** unlock advanced SQL for ML, from parsing JSON configs to syncing data with `MERGE`. These projects will have you building config parsers and optimized pipelines, creating portfolio pieces that show off your versatility. Get ready to make your *ML-Interview-Preparation-Hub* shine for AI/ML roles! 🚀

## 📈 Projects

### Project 1: JSON Config Parser
- **Description**: Build a query to extract hyperparameters from JSON configs, streamlining ML model analysis.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Use the `model_configs` table (`model_id INT, config JSON`).
  2. Write a PostgreSQL query to extract `learning_rate` and `model_type` from `config`.
  3. Test with sample JSON data (e.g., `{"hyperparams": {"lr": 0.01}, "model_type": "neural_net"}`).
  4. Export results to a CSV for reporting.
  5. Add to your portfolio with a README explaining the query and ML context.
- **Expected Outcome**: A parsed config dataset, ready for your portfolio.
- **Challenge Level**: Beginner

### Project 2: Data Sync and Partition Optimizer
- **Description**: Create a `MERGE`-based pipeline with partitioned tables for efficient ML data updates.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Use the `predictions` and `new_predictions` tables (`prediction_id INT, score FLOAT`).
  2. Write a `MERGE` query (SQL Server) to update or insert predictions.
  3. Partition the `predictions` table by `prediction_date` (e.g., 2025 range).
  4. Add a query hint to optimize reads from the partitioned table.
  5. Document in your portfolio with code, partition schema, and ML pipeline context.
- **Expected Outcome**: A synced, partitioned dataset with optimized queries, boosting your portfolio’s scalability cred.
- **Challenge Level**: Intermediate

## 🚀 How to Use These Projects

1. **Pick a Project**: Go Beginner for quick parsing or Intermediate for pipeline depth.
2. **Set Up**: Use a DB (PostgreSQL, SQL Server) with the sample tables.
3. **Code & Test**: Write queries, validate with `EXPLAIN`, and ensure JSON or partition correctness.
4. **Showcase**: Save results and add a README to `irohanportfolio.netlify.app` with ML insights.
5. **Customize**: Add JSON fields or partition keys to make projects your own!

> **Pro Tip**: Integrate with Python’s `pandas` or `sqlalchemy` for a portfolio that wows ML recruiters!
