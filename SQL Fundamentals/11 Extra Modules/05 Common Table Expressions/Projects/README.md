# 🛠️ Common Table Expressions Projects - Structured ML Queries

## 🌟 Overview

**Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** simplify complex ML queries, from multi-step pipelines to recursive hierarchies. These projects will have you building feature processors and graph analyzers, creating portfolio-worthy outputs that show off your SQL structuring skills. Let’s make your *ML-Interview-Preparation-Hub* a recruiter magnet! 🚀

## 📈 Projects

### Project 1: High-Score Model Filter
- **Description**: Use CTEs to filter and summarize high-performing models, streamlining ML evaluation.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Use the `predictions` and `models` tables (`model_id INT, model_name VARCHAR, created_date DATE`).
  2. Write a CTE to compute average `score` per `model_id`.
  3. Add a second CTE to join with `models` and filter averages above 0.85.
  4. Export results to a CSV for reporting.
  5. Add to your portfolio with a README detailing the CTEs and ML use case.
- **Expected Outcome**: A filtered model report, ready for your portfolio.
- **Challenge Level**: Beginner

### Project 2: Recursive Feature Graph Explorer
- **Description**: Build a recursive CTE to traverse a feature hierarchy, ideal for ML graph analysis.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Use the `features` table with hierarchy (`feature_id INT, parent_id INT, name VARCHAR`).
  2. Write a recursive CTE to list all features, starting from `parent_id IS NULL`.
  3. Include a `level` column to track depth.
  4. Save the hierarchy to a temporary table for visualization.
  5. Document in your portfolio with code, sample graph, and ML context.
- **Expected Outcome**: A feature hierarchy dataset, showcasing graph skills in your portfolio.
- **Challenge Level**: Intermediate

## 🚀 How to Use These Projects

1. **Choose a Project**: Start with Beginner for quick setup or tackle Intermediate for recursion flair.
2. **Set Up**: Use a DB (PostgreSQL, SQL Server) with the sample tables.
3. **Code & Test**: Build CTEs, test recursion limits, and verify outputs.
4. **Showcase**: Save results and add a README to `irohanportfolio.netlify.app` with ML insights.
5. **Enhance**: Add joins or filters to personalize your projects!

> **Pro Tip**: Pair with a Python graph library (e.g., networkx) for a portfolio that screams ML innovation!
