# 🎉 Master DateTime Functions - Unlock Time-Series ML Magic!

## 🌟 Welcome

**DateTime Functions** in SQL are your key to mastering time-based data, perfect for ML tasks like tracking prediction trends or scheduling model runs. From extracting months to aggregating by weeks, these functions handle time-series with ease. This guide will teach you datetime queries with ML examples, leveling up your *ML-Interview-Preparation-Hub*! 🚀

## 🛤️ Learning Path

1. **Understand Time**: Learn how datetime functions manipulate dates and times.
2. **Study Syntax**: Explore `EXTRACT`, `DATE_TRUNC`, and `INTERVAL` examples.
3. **Run Examples**: Try the queries below in a database like PostgreSQL.
4. **Test Use Cases**: Verify outputs for specific ML needs, like trend analysis.
5. **ML Spin**: Apply datetime queries to ML data, like prediction timelines.

## 📜 Syntax

```sql
-- Date Extraction
SELECT EXTRACT(part FROM date_column) FROM table_name;
-- Time Aggregation
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('unit', date_column) FROM table_name GROUP BY 1;
```

- **Example 1: Extract Prediction Month**:
  ```sql
  SELECT prediction_id, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM prediction_date) AS prediction_month
  FROM predictions;
  ```
  *Extracts the month from ML predictions for filtering or analysis.*

- **Example 2: Weekly Score Trends**:
  ```sql
  SELECT DATE_TRUNC('week', prediction_date) AS week,
         AVG(score) AS avg_score
  FROM predictions
  GROUP BY week
  ORDER BY week;
  ```
  *Aggregates ML prediction scores by week for performance tracking.*

- **Example 3: Schedule Retraining**:
  ```sql
  SELECT model_id,
         prediction_date + INTERVAL '30 days' AS retrain_date
  FROM predictions
  WHERE prediction_date >= '2025-04-01';
  ```
  *Sets future retraining dates for ML models.*

## 💡 Practice Tips

- **Tool Time**: Use [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io) or MySQL/PostgreSQL for datetime queries.
- **ML Use Case**: Datetime functions track ML prediction trends or schedule jobs, like monthly reports.
- **Try This**: Run the weekly trends query, tweak the period (e.g., month), and check results.
- **Note**: MySQL uses `DATE_FORMAT` instead of `DATE_TRUNC`—test both for interviews.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- **Level Up**: Revisit `Window Functions` for running totals over time or `CTEs` for recursive date ranges.
- **Portfolio Win**: Add a datetime query to `irohanportfolio.netlify.app`, showing ML trend insights.
- **Challenge**: Write a monthly aggregation query for ML predictions in a portfolio dataset.
