## 📈 Projects

### Project 1: Monthly Prediction Summarizer
- **Description**: Build a query to summarize ML prediction scores by month, creating a time-series report for analysis.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Use the `predictions` table (`prediction_id INT, model_id INT, score FLOAT, prediction_date DATE, model_name VARCHAR`).
  2. Write a PostgreSQL query to calculate average `score` per month in 2025.
  3. Test with sample data (e.g., `prediction_date` from Jan to Dec 2025).
  4. Export results to a CSV for ML reporting.
  5. Add to your portfolio with a README explaining the query and ML trend context.
- **Expected Outcome**: A monthly trend dataset, ready for your portfolio.
- **Challenge Level**: Beginner

### Project 2: Recent Model Performance Pipeline
- **Description**: Create a time-filtered pipeline joining predictions with model training dates for performance insights.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Use the `predictions` and `models` tables (`model_id INT, trained_date DATE`).
  2. Write a query to find average `score` for predictions within 30 days of `trained_date` in 2025.
  3. Add an index on `prediction_date` to optimize filtering.
  4. Save results as a CSV for ML evaluation.
  5. Document in your portfolio with code, index details, and ML pipeline context.
- **Expected Outcome**: A performance report with optimized queries, boosting your portfolio’s scalability cred.
- **Challenge Level**: Intermediate

## 🚀 How to Use These Projects

1. **Pick a Project**: Go Beginner for quick trends or Intermediate for pipeline depth.
2. **Set Up**: Use a DB (PostgreSQL, MySQL) with the sample tables.
3. **Code & Test**: Write queries, validate with `EXPLAIN`, and ensure date logic correctness.
4. **Showcase**: Save results and add a README to `irohanportfolio.netlify.app` with ML insights.
5. **Customize**: Add time periods or filters to make projects your own!

> **Pro Tip**: Integrate with Python’s `pandas` or `sqlalchemy` for a portfolio that wows ML recruiters!
