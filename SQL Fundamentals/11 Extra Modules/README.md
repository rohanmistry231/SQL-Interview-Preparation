## 🌟 What are Extra Modules?

**Extra Modules** is your go-to hub for powerful SQL techniques that don’t fit neatly into DQL, DML, or Indexing but are absolute game-changers for AI/ML workflows. From reshaping data with `PIVOT` to ranking models with `RANK`, computing running averages with window functions, building dynamic queries on the fly, crafting custom functions, or parsing JSON for embeddings, this section covers advanced tools like window functions, CTEs, JSON queries, and more. These are the skills that transform you from a SQL user to a SQL wizard, ready to tackle complex datasets and shine in technical interviews!

Whether you’re pivoting model metrics, ranking predictions for leaderboards, iterating feature hierarchies with CTEs, or querying JSON configs, Extra Modules equips you with the versatility to handle real-world ML challenges. For freshers, mastering these topics is your ticket to standing out in AI/ML roles! 💡

## 💡 Extra Modules in AI/ML: Real-World Use Cases

Extra Modules aren’t just for interviews—they’re a powerhouse in AI/ML projects! Here are examples of how these techniques drive data workflows:

- **Data Reshaping**: Use `PIVOT` to transform prediction scores into a matrix for model comparison (e.g., `PIVOT ... FOR model_id IN (101, 102)`).
- **Flexible Pipelines**: Write dynamic queries to fetch features based on runtime conditions (e.g., `EXECUTE 'SELECT * FROM features WHERE category = $1'`).
- **Custom Processing**: Create functions to compute ML metrics (e.g., `CREATE FUNCTION compute_rmse(...) RETURNS FLOAT`).
- **Ranking & Analytics**: Apply `RANK` or `ROW_NUMBER` to rank models by performance (e.g., `RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY dataset ORDER BY score DESC)`).
- **Hierarchical Data**: Use CTEs to process feature hierarchies (e.g., `WITH RECURSIVE feature_tree AS (...)` for graph-based ML).
- **Semi-Structured Data**: Query JSON configs for model parameters (e.g., `SELECT JSON_EXTRACT(config, '$.hyperparams') FROM models`).

By mastering Extra Modules, you’re equipping yourself to build smarter, faster, and more flexible ML pipelines, ready to shine in your job hunt! 🌍
