## 🌟 What are Triggers?

**Triggers** are special stored procedures that **automatically execute** in response to specific database events, such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations on a table. Defined using Data Definition Language (DDL), triggers enforce rules, maintain data integrity, or log changes without manual intervention.

In AI/ML, triggers are invaluable for **real-time data validation**, logging model inputs, or updating metadata in pipelines, ensuring robust datasets. For freshers, they’re a **key interview topic**, often tested in questions about automation, data consistency, and production-grade SQL! 💡

## 🎯 Why Triggers Matter for AI/ML Interviews

Triggers are a **must-have skill** for AI/ML roles because:

1. **Data Integrity**: Enforce rules for clean `training_data` (e.g., no null features).
2. **Interview Favorites**: Questions often involve creating triggers for audit logs.
3. **Pipeline Automation**: Update `predictions` or `logs` in real-time.
4. **Efficiency**: Reduce manual scripting for ML workflows.
5. **Broad Applicability**: Supported in MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and more.

Mastering triggers will help you automate data tasks and shine in technical interviews! 🌟

## 🗺️ Triggers Roadmap

Our Triggers journey is structured into **sub-folders**, each focusing on a core aspect of creating and managing triggers. Click the links below to explore in-depth theory, coding examples, and interview exercises for each topic! 📚

| Sub-Folder | Description | Folder Link |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Creating Triggers** | Define triggers to respond to database events. | [📂 01 Creating Triggers](./01%20Creating%20Triggers) |
| **BEFORE Triggers** | Execute logic before an event modifies data. | [📂 02 BEFORE Triggers](./02%20BEFORE%20Triggers) |
| **AFTER Triggers** | Execute logic after an event completes. | [📂 03 AFTER Triggers](./03%20AFTER%20Triggers) |
| **Dropping Triggers** | Remove triggers safely from the database. | [📂 04 Dropping Triggers](./04%20Dropping%20Triggers) |

## 🚀 How to Use This Triggers Section

1. **Start with Creating Triggers**: Learn to define triggers, the foundation of automation.
2. **Progress to BEFORE Triggers**: Master pre-event logic for validation.
3. **Explore AFTER Triggers**: Understand post-event actions for logging.
4. **Finish with Dropping Triggers**: Learn to clean up obsolete triggers safely.
5. **Folder Breakdown**: Each sub-folder contains:
   - **README.md**: Detailed theory and best practices.
   - **Coding**: Hands-on SQL queries to practice.
   - **Interview_Exercises**: Curated problems to ace interviews.
6. **Practice Regularly**: Spend 1-2 hours per sub-folder, experimenting with triggers.
7. **Focus on Interview Hits**: `Creating Triggers` and `AFTER Triggers` are fresher interview staples!

> **Pro Tip**: Test triggers in a sandbox database to avoid unintended changes—interviewers love candidates who prioritize data safety!

## 💡 Triggers in AI/ML: Real-World Use Cases

Triggers power AI/ML workflows:

- **Data Validation**: Use `BEFORE` triggers to reject invalid `training_data` rows.
- **Audit Logging**: Log `predictions` inserts with `AFTER` triggers for tracking.
- **Pipeline Sync**: Update `metadata` table on `staging_table` changes.
- **Experiment Monitoring**: Record `experiments` updates for reproducibility.
- **Feature Consistency**: Enforce rules on `features` table for ML readiness.

Triggers make your data pipelines robust and automated! 🌍

## 📚 Tips for Success

- **Start Simple**: Create basic triggers before adding complex logic.
- **Use Sandbox**: Test triggers in a non-production environment.
- **Practice Platforms**: Try LeetCode, HackerRank, or SQLZoo for trigger challenges.
- **Monitor Performance**: Avoid heavy trigger logic to prevent slowdowns.
- **Document Triggers**: Comment code to clarify event and purpose.
