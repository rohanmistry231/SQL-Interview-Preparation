## 🌟 What are Aggregations?

**Aggregations** in SQL are Data Query Language (DQL) operations that **summarize data** across rows using functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, and `MIN`, often grouped with `GROUP BY` and filtered with `HAVING`. They transform raw data into meaningful metrics, such as totals, averages, or extremes, enabling analysis and decision-making.

In AI/ML, aggregations are vital for **summarizing datasets**, calculating model performance metrics, and preparing features for training. For freshers, aggregations are a **top interview topic**, frequently tested in questions about data analysis, feature engineering, and query optimization! 💡

## 🎯 Why Aggregations Matter for AI/ML Interviews

Aggregations are a **must-have skill** for AI/ML roles because:

1. **Feature Engineering**: Summarize data for model inputs (e.g., average user activity).
2. **Interview Favorites**: Questions often involve aggregating data to solve business problems.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Calculate metrics like average accuracy or max loss.
4. **Data Insights**: Provide summaries for preprocessing and exploration.
5. **Universal Applicability**: Supported across MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and more.

Mastering aggregations will help you analyze data like a pro and ace technical interviews! 🌟

## 🗺️ Aggregations Roadmap

Our Aggregations journey is structured into **sub-folders**, each focusing on a key aggregation function or clause. Click the links below to explore in-depth theory, coding examples, and interview exercises for each topic! 📚

| Sub-Folder | Description | Folder Link |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Count** | Count rows or non-null values in a dataset. | [📂 01 Count](./01%20Count) |
| **Sum** | Calculate the total of numeric values. | [📂 02 Sum](./02%20Sum) |
| **Avg** | Compute the average of numeric values. | [📂 03 Avg](./03%20Avg) |
| **Max** | Find the highest value in a column. | [📂 04 Max](./04%20Max) |
| **Min** | Find the lowest value in a column. | [📂 05 Min](./05%20Min) |
| **Group By** | Group rows for aggregate calculations. | [📂 06 Group By](./06%20Group%20By) |
| **Having Clause** | Filter grouped results based on aggregates. | [📂 07 Having Clause](./07%20Having%20Clause) |

## 💡 Aggregations in AI/ML: Real-World Use Cases

Aggregations power AI/ML workflows:

- **Feature Engineering**: Calculate user activity (e.g., `COUNT(orders)` per `user_id`).
- **Model Evaluation**: Summarize performance (e.g., `AVG(score)` per `model_id`).
- **Data Exploration**: Find extremes (e.g., `MAX(loss)` in `predictions`).
- **Pipeline Monitoring**: Track data volume (e.g., `SUM(size)` in `training_data`).
- **Experiment Analysis**: Group results (e.g., `GROUP BY experiment_id` for `AVG(accuracy)`).

Aggregations turn raw data into ML-ready insights! 🌍

## 📚 Tips for Success

- **Start Simple**: Practice `COUNT` before tackling `HAVING`.
- **Understand Grouping**: Master `GROUP BY` for accurate aggregations.
- **Use Sandbox**: Test queries in a test database to avoid errors.
- **Practice Platforms**: Try LeetCode, HackerRank, or SQLZoo for aggregation challenges.
- **Optimize Queries**: Use indexes on grouped columns for faster ML preprocessing.
