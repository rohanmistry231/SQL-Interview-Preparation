# 🎉 Master AVG - Find Your ML Data’s Middle Ground!

## 🌟 Welcome

The **AVG** function calculates the average of numeric values, perfect for finding mean ML prediction scores or model accuracies. It’s your key to understanding central tendencies. This guide will show you `AVG` with ML examples, boosting your *ML-Interview-Preparation-Hub*! 🚀

## 🛤️ Learning Path

1. **Get the Concept**: Understand how `AVG` computes means.
2. **Learn Syntax**: Study applying `AVG` to columns.
3. **Run Examples**: Try the queries below in a database like PostgreSQL.
4. **Verify Averages**: Test with different conditions.
5. **ML Angle**: Use `AVG` to evaluate ML model performance.

## 📜 Syntax

```sql
SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name [WHERE condition];
```

- **Example 1: Average Prediction Score**:
  ```sql
  SELECT AVG(score) AS avg_score
  FROM predictions;
  ```
  *Calculates the mean ML prediction score.*

- **Example 2: Recent Predictions Average**:
  ```sql
  SELECT AVG(score) AS recent_avg
  FROM predictions
  WHERE prediction_date >= '2025-04-01';
  ```
  *Averages ML scores for recent predictions.*

- **Example 3: Model Accuracy Average**:
  ```sql
  SELECT AVG(accuracy) AS avg_accuracy
  FROM model_metrics;
  ```
  *Finds the mean ML model accuracy.*

## 💡 Practice Tips

- **Get Hands-On**: Use [SQLFiddle](http://sqlfiddle.com) or MySQL.
- **ML Use Case**: `AVG` reveals ML performance trends, like average accuracy for model tuning.
- **Try This**: Add 5 rows to `model_metrics`, average `accuracy`, and cross-check with manual math.
- **Tip**: `AVG` skips nulls—use `SELECT accuracy IS NULL` to spot them.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- **Go Deeper**: Pair `AVG` with `Group By` or try `Max` for peaks.
- **Portfolio Boost**: Add an `AVG` query to `irohanportfolio.netlify.app`, explaining ML performance analysis.
- **Challenge**: Average ML accuracies by model in a portfolio dataset.
