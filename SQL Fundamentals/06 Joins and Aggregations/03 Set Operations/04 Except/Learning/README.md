# 🎉 Master EXCEPT - Spot Your ML Data Differences!

## 🌟 Welcome

The **EXCEPT** operator returns rows unique to the first query, great for finding ML predictions in one dataset but not another, like new vs. archived logs. It’s your tool for spotting differences. This guide will teach you `EXCEPT` with ML examples, supercharging your *ML-Interview-Preparation-Hub*! 🚀

## 🛤️ Learning Path

1. **Understand Uniqueness**: Learn how `EXCEPT` keeps only first-query rows.
2. **Study Syntax**: See how to compare queries for differences.
3. **Run Examples**: Try the queries below in a database like PostgreSQL.
4. **Test Differences**: Verify only unique rows remain.
5. **ML Spin**: Use `EXCEPT` to identify new or missing ML data.

## 📜 Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
[WHERE condition]
EXCEPT
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2
[WHERE condition];
```

- **Example 1: New Predictions**:
  ```sql
  SELECT prediction_id, score
  FROM predictions
  EXCEPT
  SELECT prediction_id, score
  FROM archive_predictions;
  ```
  *Finds ML predictions only in the current table.*

- **Example 2: Unique High Scores**:
  ```sql
  SELECT prediction_id, score
  FROM predictions
  WHERE score >= 0.9
  EXCEPT
  SELECT prediction_id, score
  FROM archive_predictions
  WHERE score >= 0.9;
  ```
  *Spots high-scoring ML predictions not in archives.*

- **Example 3: Unlogged Models**:
  ```sql
  SELECT model_id
  FROM predictions
  EXCEPT
  SELECT model_id
  FROM model_metrics;
  ```
  *Identifies ML models with predictions but no metrics.*

## 💡 Practice Tips

- **Tool Time**: Practice on [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com) or PostgreSQL (MySQL lacks `EXCEPT`).
- **ML Use Case**: `EXCEPT` highlights new ML data, like predictions not yet archived.
- **Try This**: Add unique rows to `predictions`, run `EXCEPT` with `archive_predictions`, and check results.
- **Note**: Column types must match—use `SELECT` to test each query separately first.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- **Level Up**: Compare with `Intersect` for overlaps or `Union All` for merges.
- **Portfolio Win**: Add an `EXCEPT` query to `irohanportfolio.netlify.app`, showing ML data differences.
- **Challenge**: Find unique ML predictions in a portfolio dataset.
