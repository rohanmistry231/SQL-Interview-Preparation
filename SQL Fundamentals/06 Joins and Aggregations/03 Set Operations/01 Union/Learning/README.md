# 🎉 Master UNION - Combine Your ML Datasets Like a Champ!

## 🌟 Welcome

The **UNION** operator merges rows from multiple queries, removing duplicates, perfect for combining ML predictions from different sources. It’s your go-to for clean, unified datasets. This guide will walk you through learning `UNION` with ML-themed examples, powering up your *ML-Interview-Preparation-Hub*! 🚀

## 🛤️ Learning Path

1. **Grasp the Basics**: Understand how `UNION` stacks unique rows.
2. **Study the Syntax**: Learn to combine compatible queries.
3. **Run Examples**: Try the queries below in a database like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
4. **Test Uniqueness**: Verify duplicates are removed.
5. **Apply to ML**: Use `UNION` to merge ML datasets for analysis.

## 📜 Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
[WHERE condition]
UNION
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2
[WHERE condition];
```

- **Example 1: Merge Predictions**:
  ```sql
  SELECT prediction_id, score, model_name
  FROM predictions
  UNION
  SELECT prediction_id, score, model_name
  FROM archive_predictions;
  ```
  *Combines ML predictions from current and archived tables, no duplicates.*

- **Example 2: High-Score Union**:
  ```sql
  SELECT prediction_id, score
  FROM predictions
  WHERE score >= 0.9
  UNION
  SELECT prediction_id, score
  FROM archive_predictions
  WHERE score >= 0.9;
  ```
  *Merges high-scoring ML predictions from both sources.*

- **Example 3: Model Metrics Union**:
  ```sql
  SELECT model_id, accuracy AS performance
  FROM model_metrics
  WHERE log_date >= '2025-04-01'
  UNION
  SELECT model_id, score AS performance
  FROM predictions
  WHERE prediction_date >= '2025-04-01';
  ```
  *Unifies ML performance metrics and prediction scores.*

## 💡 Practice Tips

- **Tool Up**: Use [SQLFiddle](http://sqlfiddle.com) or a local DB to test unions.
- **ML Use Case**: `UNION` consolidates ML data, like merging prediction logs for model evaluation.
- **Try This**: Create `predictions` and `archive_predictions` with overlapping rows, run a `UNION`, and check for duplicates with `SELECT COUNT(*)`.
- **Debug**: Ensure column counts and types match—mismatched queries fail. Use `ORDER BY` after `UNION` to sort results.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- **Deepen Skills**: Explore `Union All` for faster merges or `Intersect` for common rows.
- **Portfolio Boost**: Add a `UNION` query to `irohanportfolio.netlify.app`, explaining its ML data merging role.
- **Challenge**: Merge ML predictions from two tables in a portfolio dataset.
