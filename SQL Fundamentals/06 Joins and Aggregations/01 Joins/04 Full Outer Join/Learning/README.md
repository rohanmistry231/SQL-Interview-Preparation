# üéâ Master FULL OUTER JOIN - Capture All Your ML Data!

## üåü Welcome

The **FULL OUTER JOIN** keeps all rows from both tables, matching where possible, ideal for analyzing complete ML datasets, like all predictions and models, matched or not. It‚Äôs your tool for total inclusion. This guide will teach you `FULL OUTER JOIN` with ML examples, supercharging your *ML-Interview-Preparation-Hub*! üöÄ

## üõ§Ô∏è Learning Path

1. **Understand Completeness**: Learn how `FULL OUTER JOIN` includes all rows.
2. **Study Syntax**: See how to join with `ON` and handle nulls.
3. **Run Examples**: Try the queries below in a database like PostgreSQL.
4. **Check Nulls**: Identify unmatched rows in both tables.
5. **ML Spin**: Use `FULL OUTER JOIN` for comprehensive ML data insights.

## üìú Syntax

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

- **Example 1: All Predictions and Models**:
  ```sql
  SELECT p.prediction_id, p.score, m.model_name
  FROM predictions p
  FULL OUTER JOIN models m
  ON p.model_id = m.model_id;
  ```
  *Shows all ML predictions and models, with nulls for mismatches.*

- **Example 2: Metrics and Models**:
  ```sql
  SELECT mm.metric_id, mm.accuracy, m.model_name
  FROM model_metrics mm
  FULL OUTER JOIN models m
  ON mm.model_id = m.model_id;
  ```
  *Includes all ML metrics and models, matched or not.*

- **Example 3: Find Mismatches**:
  ```sql
  SELECT p.prediction_id, m.model_name
  FROM predictions p
  FULL OUTER JOIN models m
  ON p.model_id = m.model_id
  WHERE p.prediction_id IS NULL OR m.model_id IS NULL;
  ```
  *Spots unpaired ML predictions or models.*

## üí° Practice Tips

- **Tool Time**: Practice on [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com) or MySQL.
- **ML Use Case**: `FULL OUTER JOIN` reveals gaps in ML datasets, like missing model links.
- **Try This**: Join `predictions` to `models` with `FULL OUTER JOIN`, count nulls in both tables.
- **Note**: Not all DBs support `FULL OUTER JOIN` (e.g., MySQL)‚Äîtest with PostgreSQL.

## üöÄ Next Steps

- **Level Up**: Compare with `Inner Join` or `Left Join` for partial matches.
- **Portfolio Win**: Add a `FULL OUTER JOIN` query to `irohanportfolio.netlify.app`, showing ML data completeness.
- **Challenge**: Analyze unmatched ML data in a portfolio dataset.
