# 🎉 Master SELF-JOIN - Relate Your ML Data to Itself!

## 🌟 Welcome

The **Self-Join** joins a table to itself, perfect for hierarchical or comparative ML data, like pairing predictions by model or date. It’s your trick for internal relationships. This guide will teach you `SELF-JOIN` with ML examples, boosting your *ML-Interview-Preparation-Hub*! 🚀

## 🛤️ Learning Path

1. **Get the Idea**: Understand how `SELF-JOIN` compares rows within one table.
2. **Learn Syntax**: Study aliasing for clarity in joins.
3. **Run Examples**: Try the queries below in a database like MySQL.
4. **Test Comparisons**: Check paired rows for accuracy.
5. **ML Angle**: Use `SELF-JOIN` to analyze ML prediction patterns.

## 📜 Syntax

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table_name t1
INNER JOIN table_name t2
ON t1.column = t2.column;
```

- **Example 1: Compare Predictions**:
  ```sql
  SELECT p1.prediction_id, p1.score, p2.score AS compare_score
  FROM predictions p1
  INNER JOIN predictions p2
  ON p1.model_id = p2.model_id
  WHERE p1.prediction_id < p2.prediction_id;
  ```
  *Compares ML prediction scores for the same model.*

- **Example 2: Date Proximity**:
  ```sql
  SELECT p1.prediction_id, p1.prediction_date, p2.prediction_date AS next_date
  FROM predictions p1
  INNER JOIN predictions p2
  ON p1.model_id = p2.model_id
  WHERE p2.prediction_date = p1.prediction_date + INTERVAL '1 day';
  ```
  *Finds consecutive ML predictions by date.*

- **Example 3: Score Gaps**:
  ```sql
  SELECT p1.prediction_id, p1.score, p2.score
  FROM predictions p1
  INNER JOIN predictions p2
  ON p1.model_id = p2.model_id
  WHERE p2.score > p1.score + 0.1;
  ```
  *Spots significant ML score improvements.*

## 💡 Practice Tips

- **Get Hands-On**: Use [SQLFiddle](http://sqlfiddle.com) or PostgreSQL.
- **ML Use Case**: `SELF-JOIN` uncovers ML trends, like comparing prediction performance.
- **Try This**: Create `predictions`, self-join by `model_id`, and verify paired scores.
- **Tip**: Aliases (e.g., `p1`, `p2`) are critical—without them, queries get messy.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- **Go Deeper**: Try `Inner Join` for cross-table joins or `Aggregations` for trends.
- **Portfolio Boost**: Add a `SELF-JOIN` query to `irohanportfolio.netlify.app`, explaining ML comparisons.
- **Challenge**: Compare ML predictions by date in a portfolio dataset.
