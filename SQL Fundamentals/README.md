## 🚀 How to Navigate This Roadmap

1. **Start with DQL**: Learn to query data, the foundation of SQL (perfect for freshers).
2. **Progress Sequentially**: Move to DML, DDL, and beyond to build comprehensive skills.
3. **Explore Sub-Folders**: Each main folder contains:
   - **README.md**: In-depth theory and guidance.
   - **Sub-Folders**: Focused topics with their own READMEs.
   - **Coding**: Hands-on SQL queries to practice.
   - **Interview_Exercises**: Curated problems to ace interviews.
4. **Practice Regularly**: Spend 2-3 hours per main folder, diving deeper into sub-topics.
5. **Focus on Interview Hits**: Prioritize DQL, DML, and Joins/Aggregations for fresher interviews.

> **Pro Tip**: Use a sample database (e.g., MySQL’s `sakila` or PostgreSQL’s `dvdrental`) to practice queries hands-on—interviewers love practical SQL skills!

## 💡 SQL in AI/ML: Real-World Impact

SQL is a powerhouse in AI/ML workflows:

- **Data Preparation**: Query and clean data with DQL/DML (e.g., `SELECT * FROM raw_data WHERE valid = 1`).
- **Feature Engineering**: Aggregate features with Joins (e.g., `SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) FROM orders GROUP BY user_id`).
- **Schema Design**: Define tables for models with DDL (e.g., `CREATE TABLE predictions (...)`).
- **Automation**: Use Stored Procedures and Triggers to streamline pipelines.
- **Security**: Manage access with DCL to protect sensitive data.

SQL ensures your data is structured, clean, and ready for machine learning success! 🌍

## 📚 Tips for Success

- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic `SELECT` queries before tackling triggers or cursors.
- **Practice Daily**: Write 5-10 queries daily to build muscle memory.
- **Understand Databases**: Experiment with MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite to see variations.
- **Use Online Tools**: Platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and SQLZoo offer great SQL challenges.
- **Explain Your Logic**: Practice verbalizing query logic for interviews.
