## üíº Scenario Breakdown

Here are two AI/ML-themed scenarios with SQL challenges:

- **Scenario 1: E-Commerce Retention Analysis**
  - **Context**: An e-commerce company wants to identify loyal customers for an ML-driven loyalty program. You‚Äôre given an `orders` table (`order_id INT, customer_id INT, amount FLOAT, order_date DATE`).
  - **Task**: Find customers who placed at least 3 orders in 2025, with a total spend over $500.
  - **Solution**:
    ```sql
    SELECT customer_id,
           COUNT(*) AS order_count,
           SUM(amount) AS total_spend
    FROM orders
    WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-12-31'
    GROUP BY customer_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3 AND SUM(amount) > 500
    ORDER BY total_spend DESC;
    ```
    *Identifies loyal customers for ML targeting.*

- **Scenario 2: ML Model Performance Audit**
  - **Context**: A data science team needs to audit ML model predictions for quality. You‚Äôre given a `predictions` table (`prediction_id INT, model_id INT, score FLOAT, prediction_date DATE, model_name VARCHAR`).
  - **Task**: Flag models with average scores below 0.7 in April 2025 and update their names to ‚ÄòUnderperforming‚Äô.
  - **Solution**:
    ```sql
    WITH LowPerformers AS (
        SELECT model_id, model_name,
               AVG(score) AS avg_score
        FROM predictions
        WHERE prediction_date BETWEEN '2025-04-01' AND '2025-04-30'
        GROUP BY model_id, model_name
        HAVING AVG(score) < 0.7
    )
    UPDATE predictions
    SET model_name = 'Underperforming'
    WHERE model_id IN (SELECT model_id FROM LowPerformers);
    ```
    *Audits and updates ML models for quality control.*

## ‚ùì Questions and Answers

Here are sample interview questions with detailed answers:

- **Q1**: How would you identify top-performing customers in an e-commerce dataset for an ML recommendation system?
  - **A**: I‚Äôd use the `orders` table to calculate metrics like order count and total spend, filtering for high-value customers. For example:
    ```sql
    SELECT customer_id,
           COUNT(*) AS orders,
           SUM(amount) AS total_spent
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 5 AND SUM(amount) > 1000
    ORDER BY total_spent DESC
    LIMIT 10;
    ```
    This query finds customers with over 5 orders and $1000 spent, ideal for ML recommendations. I‚Äôd ensure `customer_id` is indexed for performance.

- **Q2**: How can you clean a predictions table by removing invalid scores before ML training?
  - **A**: I‚Äôd identify invalid scores (e.g., outside 0-1) and delete them safely:
    ```sql
    BEGIN;
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM predictions WHERE score < 0 OR score > 1;
    DELETE FROM predictions WHERE score < 0 OR score > 1;
    COMMIT;
    ```
    I‚Äôd use a transaction to verify the count first, ensuring no valid data is lost. This preps clean data for training.

- **Q3**: How would you update outdated model metadata in a predictions table?
  - **A**: I‚Äôd target specific models and update their metadata:
    ```sql
    UPDATE predictions
    SET model_name = CONCAT(model_name, '_v2')
    WHERE model_id = 101 AND prediction_date < '2025-04-01';
    ```
    This appends a version suffix to old predictions, maintaining clarity for ML analysis. I‚Äôd test the `WHERE` with `SELECT` first.

- **Q4**: How do you optimize a query for a large dataset in a case study?
  - **A**: I‚Äôd index frequently filtered columns, avoid unnecessary joins, and use aggregates efficiently:
    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX idx_orders_date ON orders(order_date);
    SELECT customer_id, AVG(amount)
    FROM orders
    WHERE order_date >= '2025-01-01'
    GROUP BY customer_id;
    ```
    The index speeds up filtering, and I‚Äôd analyze the query plan to confirm efficiency.

## üîë Key Skills Tested

- **Query Writing**: Crafting accurate SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, and JOIN queries.
- **Problem-Solving**: Translating business needs into SQL solutions.
- **Optimization**: Using indexes and efficient clauses for performance.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling nulls, outliers, and constraints.
- **Communication**: Explaining query logic clearly in interviews.

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- **Understand the Scenario**: Ask clarifying questions about data and goals.
- **Break Down Problems**: Solve step-by-step (e.g., filter, then aggregate).
- **Test Queries**: Run `SELECT` to preview results before modifying data.
- **Explain Logic**: Walk through your query‚Äôs purpose and optimizations.
- **Practice Variety**: Cover DQL, DML, and DDL in case studies.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

- **Vague Requirements**: Misinterpreting the problem‚Äîalways clarify.
- **Unoptimized Queries**: Forgetting indexes or scanning large tables.
- **Data Loss**: Running `DELETE` or `UPDATE` without testing conditions.
- **Overcomplicating**: Writing complex queries when simple ones suffice.
- **Ignoring Constraints**: Missing primary or foreign key impacts.

## üìù Additional Notes

- **Resources**: Use [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com), or [Mode Analytics](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/) for case study practice.
- **Mock Interviews**: Simulate explaining your queries to build confidence.
- **Portfolio Tip**: Add solved case studies to `irohanportfolio.netlify.app` with query outputs as CSVs.
- **DB Variations**: MySQL may need simpler joins; PostgreSQL excels at CTEs for case studies.
