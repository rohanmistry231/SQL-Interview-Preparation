## 🌟 What is DQL?

**Data Query Language (DQL)** is the subset of SQL used to **retrieve and query data** from databases. It’s your go-to tool for extracting insights, preprocessing datasets, and answering critical business questions in AI/ML workflows. At its core, DQL revolves around the **SELECT** statement, but it’s so much more—think filtering, sorting, aggregating, and diving deep into subqueries!

Whether you’re fetching customer data for a recommendation system or analyzing sales trends for a machine learning model, DQL is the **backbone of data manipulation** in SQL. Mastering DQL is non-negotiable for freshers aiming to shine in technical interviews! 💡

## 🎯 Why DQL Matters for AI/ML Interviews

DQL is a **must-have skill** for AI/ML roles, and here’s why:

1. **Data Retrieval**: DQL powers the extraction of clean, relevant data for training ML models.
2. **Interview Staple**: 80% of SQL interview questions revolve around SELECT queries, JOINs, and aggregations—all part of DQL.
3. **Real-World Impact**: From exploratory data analysis to feature engineering, DQL skills drive AI/ML success.
4. **Efficiency**: Writing optimized DQL queries ensures you handle large datasets like a pro.
5. **Versatility**: DQL applies across databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite—universal skills for any tech stack.

As a fresher, nailing DQL means you’re ready to tackle coding tests, whiteboard challenges, and conceptual questions with confidence! 🌟

## 🗺️ DQL Roadmap

Our DQL journey is structured into **sub-nodes**, each diving deep into a critical aspect of querying. Click the links below to explore each topic, complete with in-depth theory, coding examples, and interview exercises! 📚

| Sub-Node | Description | Folder Link |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **SELECT Operations** | Master the art of SELECT, filtering with WHERE, and operators like LIKE, IN, and BETWEEN. | [📂 01_SELECT_Operations](./01_SELECT_Operations) |
| **Sorting and Limits** | Learn to order results with ORDER BY and limit outputs with LIMIT, OFFSET, and TOP. | [📂 02_Sorting_and_Limits](./02_Sorting_and_Limits) |
| **Subqueries** | Unlock the power of nested queries, correlated subqueries, and multi-row operations. | [📂 03_Subqueries](./03_Subqueries) |
| **Conditional Logic** | Explore CASE statements, COALESCE, and NULLIF for dynamic query logic. | [📂 04_Conditional_Logic](./04_Conditional_Logic) |

## 🚀 How to Use This DQL Section

1. **Start with SELECT Operations**: Build your foundation with SELECT, WHERE, and filtering techniques—the bread and butter of SQL interviews.
2. **Progress Logically**: Move to Sorting and Limits, then Subqueries, and finally Conditional Logic for advanced querying.
3. **Dive into Folders**: Each sub-node folder contains:
   - **README.md**: In-depth theory and best practices.
   - **Coding**: Hands-on SQL queries to practice.
   - **Interview_Exercises**: Curated problems to ace interviews.
4. **Practice Daily**: Spend 1-2 hours per sub-node, coding and solving exercises.
5. **Track Progress**: Check off completed topics to stay motivated! ✅

> **Pro Tip**: Focus on SELECT Operations and Sorting for fresher interviews, as they cover 70% of DQL questions. Subqueries and Conditional Logic are great for standing out in tougher rounds!

## 💡 DQL in AI/ML: Real-World Use Cases

DQL isn’t just for interviews—it’s a game-changer in AI/ML projects! Here are examples of how DQL powers data workflows:

- **Feature Engineering**: Use SELECT and WHERE to filter relevant features (e.g., `SELECT user_id, purchase_amount FROM transactions WHERE date > '2024-01-01'`).
- **Data Cleaning**: Leverage Conditional Logic to handle missing values (e.g., `COALESCE(column, 0)`).
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Run aggregations with Subqueries to summarize data (e.g., `SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE dept IN (SELECT dept FROM departments WHERE region = 'Asia')`).
- **Model Validation**: Query test datasets with Sorting to evaluate ML predictions (e.g., `SELECT * FROM predictions ORDER BY confidence DESC LIMIT 10`).

By mastering DQL, you’re equipping yourself to handle real-world data challenges like a pro! 🌍
