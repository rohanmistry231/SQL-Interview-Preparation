# 🎉 Master the LIKE Operator - Hunt for ML Text Patterns!

## 🌟 Welcome

The **LIKE Operator** searches for patterns in text, perfect for finding model names or categories in ML datasets. Paired with wildcards, it’s your go-to for fuzzy matching in data exploration. This guide will show you how to learn `LIKE` with ML examples, leveling up your *ML-Interview-Preparation-Hub*! 🚀

## 🛤️ Learning Path

1. **Know the Goal**: Understand `LIKE` finds text matching a pattern.
2. **Learn Syntax**: Study `LIKE` with `%` and `_` wildcards.
3. **Run Examples**: Try the queries below in a database like PostgreSQL.
4. **Mix It Up**: Change patterns to test different matches.
5. **ML Spin**: Use `LIKE` to filter text data for ML preprocessing.

## 📜 Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE column LIKE pattern;
```

- **Example 1: Model Name Search**:
  ```sql
  SELECT model_id, model_name FROM predictions WHERE model_name LIKE 'Neural%';
  ```
  *Finds models starting with 'Neural', like filtering neural nets for ML analysis.*

- **Example 2: Partial Match**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM predictions WHERE model_name LIKE '%Boost%';
  ```
  *Matches 'Boost' anywhere, great for finding boosting models like XGBoost.*

- **Example 3: Single Character**:
  ```sql
  SELECT model_name FROM predictions WHERE model_name LIKE 'X_Boost';
  ```
  *Matches 'X_Boost' with one character (e.g., 'XGBoost'), useful for precise ML tags.*

## 💡 Practice Tips

- **Tool Up**: Test on [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com) or MySQL.
- **ML Use Case**: `LIKE` helps filter text-based features (e.g., model types, labels) for ML pipelines.
- **Try This**: Add `model_name`s like 'NeuralNet', 'XGBoost' to `predictions`, then use `LIKE '%Net%'`. Count matches.
- **Note**: `LIKE` is case-sensitive in some DBs (e.g., PostgreSQL)—use `ILIKE` for case-insensitive matches.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- **Expand Skills**: Pair `LIKE` with `Wildcard Operator` for advanced patterns or `WHERE` for combined filters.
- **Portfolio Win**: Add a `LIKE` query to `irohanportfolio.netlify.app`, showing text filtering for ML.
- **Challenge**: Find models with 'Net' in `model_name` for a portfolio ML report.
