# 🎉 Master AND, OR, NOT - Combine ML Filters with Ease!

## 🌟 Welcome

The **AND, OR, NOT** operators combine conditions in `WHERE`, letting you craft precise ML data filters like high scores from specific models. They’re your tools for building complex queries fast. This guide will teach you `AND, OR, NOT` with ML examples, leveling up your *ML-Interview-Preparation-Hub*! 🚀

## 🛤️ Learning Path

1. **Get the Logic**: Understand `AND` (all true), `OR` (any true), `NOT` (exclude).
2. **Study Syntax**: Learn how they fit into `WHERE`.
3. **Run Examples**: Try the queries below in a database like MySQL.
4. **Mix Conditions**: Combine operators to test different filters.
5. **ML Spin**: Use `AND, OR, NOT` to refine ML datasets.

## 📜 Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name 
WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
-- OR
WHERE condition1 OR condition2;
-- OR
WHERE NOT condition;
```

- **Example 1: AND Filter**:
  ```sql
  SELECT prediction_id, score FROM predictions 
  WHERE model_id = 101 AND score > 0.9;
  ```
  *Fetches high scores for `model_id = 101`, like selecting top ML predictions.*

- **Example 2: OR Filter**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM predictions 
  WHERE model_name = 'NeuralNet' OR model_name = 'XGBoost';
  ```
  *Grabs rows for either model, great for comparing ML models.*

- **Example 3: NOT Filter**:
  ```sql
  SELECT model_id, model_name FROM predictions 
  WHERE NOT model_name = 'NeuralNet';
  ```
  *Excludes 'NeuralNet', useful for filtering out specific ML categories.*

## 💡 Practice Tips

- **Get Hands-On**: Use [SQLFiddle](http://sqlfiddle.com) or PostgreSQL.
- **ML Use Case**: `AND, OR, NOT` help build precise feature filters for ML pipelines.
- **Try This**: Add 10 rows to `predictions`, then use `model_id = 102 AND score < 0.8`. Check results.
- **Tip**: Use parentheses with multiple operators (e.g., `(A AND B) OR C`) to control logic.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- **Go Further**: Pair `AND, OR, NOT` with `WHERE`, `IN`, or `BETWEEN` for complex queries.
- **Portfolio Boost**: Add an `AND, OR, NOT` query to `irohanportfolio.netlify.app`, explaining ML filtering.
- **Challenge**: Combine `AND` and `OR` to filter scores and models for a portfolio ML report.
