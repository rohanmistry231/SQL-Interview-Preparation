# üîó AND, OR, NOT - Logical Operators for Complex Filtering

## üåü Overview

The **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT** logical operators in a `WHERE` clause combine multiple conditions to create complex filtering logic. They allow you to build precise queries, critical for selecting targeted datasets in AI/ML workflows.

## üìú Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
```

- **AND Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT product_name
  FROM products
  WHERE price > 100 AND stock > 10;
  ```
- **OR Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT first_name
  FROM employees
  WHERE department = 'HR' OR department = 'IT';
  ```
- **NOT Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT order_id
  FROM orders
  WHERE NOT status = 'Cancelled';
  ```

## üí° Use Cases in AI/ML

- **Multi-Condition Filtering**: Select data meeting multiple criteria (e.g., `SELECT * FROM customers WHERE age > 25 AND region = 'West'`).
- **Alternative Conditions**: Include rows from multiple categories (e.g., `SELECT * FROM sales WHERE product = 'Phone' OR product = 'Laptop'`).
- **Exclusion Logic**: Exclude specific records (e.g., `SELECT * FROM logins WHERE NOT user_id = 0`).
- **Complex Segmentation**: Combine conditions for cohort analysis (e.g., `SELECT * FROM users WHERE (age < 30 AND income > 50000) OR vip_status = 1`).

## üîë Key Features

- **AND**: Both conditions must be true for a row to be included.
- **OR**: At least one condition must be true.
- **NOT**: Inverts the truth of a condition.
- **Precedence**: `AND` has higher precedence than `OR`; use parentheses for clarity.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- **Use Parentheses**: Clarify logic with parentheses (e.g., `WHERE (A OR B) AND C`).
- **Optimize Conditions**: Place restrictive conditions first to reduce the number of rows processed.
- **Avoid Overcomplication**: Simplify complex logic with subqueries or temporary tables if needed.
- **Test Logic**: Validate combined conditions with small datasets to ensure correctness.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

- **Precedence Errors**: Misplacing `AND`/`OR` without parentheses can change results (e.g., `A OR B AND C` is `A OR (B AND C)`).
- **NULL Handling**: NULLs in conditions affect logic (e.g., `NULL AND TRUE` is NULL).
- **Redundant Conditions**: Overlapping `AND`/`OR` logic can slow queries or produce unexpected results.
- **NOT Misuse**: Using `NOT` with complex conditions can make queries hard to read; consider alternatives like `!=`.

## üìù Additional Notes

- **Database Variations**: Logical operators are standard, but NULL behavior is consistent across databases.
- **Performance**: Complex logic with many `OR` conditions may benefit from rewriting as `IN` or `UNION`.
- **Debugging**: Use `EXPLAIN` to check how logical conditions affect query plans.
