# üï≥Ô∏è IS NULL - Handling Missing Data

## üåü Overview

The **IS NULL** condition in a `WHERE` clause filters rows where a column contains a `NULL` value, while `IS NOT NULL` selects non-NULL values. It‚Äôs crucial for data cleaning and validation in AI/ML, where missing data can skew model performance.

## üìú Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE column IS NULL;
```

- **IS NULL Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT customer_id
  FROM customers
  WHERE email IS NULL;
  ```
- **IS NOT NULL Example**:
  ```sql
  SELECT order_id
  FROM orders
  WHERE delivery_date IS NOT NULL;
  ```

## üí° Use Cases in AI/ML

- **Data Cleaning**: Identify missing values for imputation (e.g., `SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE age IS NULL`).
- **Quality Checks**: Ensure critical fields are populated (e.g., `SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE amount IS NOT NULL`).
- **Feature Validation**: Exclude incomplete records (e.g., `SELECT user_id FROM logins WHERE session_id IS NOT NULL`).
- **Missing Data Analysis**: Quantify NULLs in datasets (e.g., `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees WHERE manager_id IS NULL`).

## üîë Key Features

- **NULL-Specific**: Unlike `= NULL`, which fails, `IS NULL` correctly identifies NULL values.
- **Boolean Logic**: Returns true/false based on the presence of NULL.
- **Universal**: Works with any data type (numbers, strings, dates).

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- **Use IS NULL Explicitly**: Never use `= NULL` or `!= NULL`, as they don‚Äôt work as expected.
- **Combine with Other Filters**: Narrow results for efficiency (e.g., `WHERE department = 'HR' AND manager_id IS NULL`).
- **Check Indexes**: Filtering on NULLs may not use indexes unless explicitly designed (e.g., partial indexes in PostgreSQL).
- **Document NULLs**: Understand why NULLs exist in your data to avoid misinterpretation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

- **Misusing Equality**: Writing `WHERE column = NULL` instead of `IS NULL` returns no rows.
- **Assuming Non-NULL**: Forgetting to check for NULLs can include invalid data in ML models.
- **Performance**: Filtering NULLs on unindexed columns can be slow in large datasets.
- **Logical Errors**: NULLs affect `AND`/`OR` logic differently (e.g., `NULL AND TRUE` is NULL).

## üìù Additional Notes

- **Database Variations**: IS NULL is standard across MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.
- **NULL Semantics**: NULL represents unknown or missing data, not zero or an empty string.
- **Alternatives**: For handling NULLs in calculations, consider `COALESCE` (covered in Conditional Logic).
