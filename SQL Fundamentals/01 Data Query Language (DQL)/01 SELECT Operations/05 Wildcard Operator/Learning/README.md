# 🎉 Master the Wildcard Operator - Unlock Flexible ML Filters!

## 🌟 Welcome

**Wildcard Operators** (`%` and `_`) supercharge `LIKE`, letting you match flexible text patterns in ML data, like model names or feature tags. They’re key for exploring datasets with partial info. This guide will teach you wildcards with ML examples, making your *ML-Interview-Preparation-Hub* shine! 🚀

## 🛤️ Learning Path

1. **Understand Wildcards**: Learn `%` (any characters) vs. `_` (one character).
2. **Study Syntax**: See how wildcards work with `LIKE`.
3. **Try Examples**: Run the queries below in a database like MySQL.
4. **Experiment**: Test different patterns to master matching.
5. **ML Angle**: Use wildcards to filter text for ML feature prep.

## 📜 Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE column LIKE pattern;
-- %: Any number of characters
-- _: Exactly one character
```

- **Example 1: Broad Match**:
  ```sql
  SELECT model_name FROM predictions WHERE model_name LIKE 'N%';
  ```
  *Matches names starting with 'N' (e.g., 'NeuralNet'), like filtering ML model types.*

- **Example 2: Specific Position**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM predictions WHERE model_name LIKE '_GBoost';
  ```
  *Matches 'XGBoost' with one character before 'GBoost', great for precise ML tags.*

- **Example 3: Middle Match**:
  ```sql
  SELECT model_id, model_name FROM predictions WHERE model_name LIKE '%Net%';
  ```
  *Finds 'Net' anywhere, useful for grabbing neural network models.*

## 💡 Practice Tips

- **Get Hands-On**: Use [SQLFiddle](http://sqlfiddle.com) or PostgreSQL.
- **ML Use Case**: Wildcards help filter text features (e.g., model categories) for ML datasets.
- **Try This**: Add `model_name`s like 'NeuralNet', 'XGBoost', then try `LIKE 'X%ost'`. Check results.
- **Tip**: Combine `%` and `_` for complex patterns, but keep patterns specific to avoid over-matching.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- **Go Further**: Use wildcards with `LIKE Operator` or `AND, OR, NOT` for advanced filters.
- **Portfolio Boost**: Add a wildcard query to `irohanportfolio.netlify.app`, explaining its ML role.
- **Challenge**: Match models ending in 'Boost' for a portfolio ML feature list.
