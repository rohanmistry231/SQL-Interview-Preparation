## 🌟 What is Conditional Logic?

**Conditional Logic** in SQL allows you to apply **if-then-else** style reasoning within queries, transforming data based on specific conditions. It enables dynamic calculations, data cleaning, and categorization without external processing. Tools like `CASE`, `COALESCE`, and `NULLIF` let you handle complex scenarios directly in SQL, making your queries more powerful and efficient.

In AI/ML, conditional logic is crucial for tasks like feature engineering, handling missing data, and creating derived columns for modeling. For freshers, these concepts are **interview gold**, appearing in coding tests and data manipulation questions! 💡

## 🎯 Why Conditional Logic Matters for AI/ML Interviews

Conditional Logic is a **must-know** for AI/ML roles because:

1. **Data Transformation**: Enables on-the-fly categorization and calculations for model-ready data.
2. **Interview Staples**: Questions often test `CASE` for logic or `COALESCE` for NULL handling.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Simplifies handling missing or inconsistent values, critical for ML pipelines.
4. **Flexibility**: Works in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `ORDER BY` clauses for diverse applications.
5. **Universal Skills**: Supported across MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and more.

Mastering conditional logic will help you write versatile queries and shine in technical interviews! 🌟

## 🗺️ Conditional Logic Roadmap

Our Conditional Logic journey is structured into **leaf nodes**, each focusing on a key conditional tool. Click the links below to explore in-depth theory, coding examples, and interview exercises for each topic! 📚

| Leaf Node | Description | Folder Link |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Case Statements** | Apply if-then-else logic to transform or categorize data dynamically. | [📂 01 Case Statements](./01%20Case%20Statements) |
| **Coalesce** | Return the first non-NULL value from a list, perfect for handling missing data. | [📂 02 Coalesce](./02%20Coalesce) |
| **Nullif** | Convert specific values to NULL based on conditions, aiding data cleanup. | [📂 03 Nullif](./03%20Nullif) |

## 🚀 How to Use This Conditional Logic Section

1. **Start with Case Statements**: Learn to apply conditional logic for categorization and transformations.
2. **Progress to Coalesce and Nullif**: Master NULL handling for robust data cleaning.
3. **Explore Each Folder**: Every leaf node folder contains:
   - **README.md**: Detailed theory and best practices.
   - **Coding**: Hands-on SQL queries to practice.
   - **Interview_Exercises**: Curated problems to ace interviews.
4. **Practice Regularly**: Spend 1-2 hours per leaf node, experimenting with logic scenarios.
5. **Focus on Interview Favorites**: `Case Statements` and `Coalesce` are common in fresher interviews, so prioritize them!

> **Pro Tip**: Practice combining `CASE` with aggregations or `COALESCE` with NULL-heavy datasets—interviewers love these skills!

## 💡 Conditional Logic in AI/ML: Real-World Use Cases

Conditional Logic is a game-changer in AI/ML workflows:

- **Feature Engineering**: Categorize data with `CASE` (e.g., `SELECT CASE WHEN age < 30 THEN 'Young' ELSE 'Adult' END AS age_group FROM users`).
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values with `COALESCE` (e.g., `SELECT COALESCE(delivery_date, 'Unknown') FROM orders`).
- **Data Validation**: Use `NULLIF` to standardize invalid data (e.g., `SELECT NULLIF(price, 0) AS cleaned_price FROM products`).
- **Model Reporting**: Create dynamic metrics (e.g., `SELECT CASE WHEN score > 0.8 THEN 'High' ELSE 'Low' END AS confidence FROM predictions`).

These tools help you prepare clean, meaningful data for machine learning models! 🌍

## 📚 Tips for Success

- **Start Simple**: Write basic `CASE` statements before tackling complex logic.
- **Test Conditions**: Verify conditional outputs with small datasets.
- **Optimize for Readability**: Use clear, concise logic to make queries maintainable.
- **Practice Platforms**: Try LeetCode, HackerRank, or Mode Analytics for conditional logic challenges.
- **Understand NULLs**: Master how `COALESCE` and `NULLIF` interact with NULL values.
