## 🌟 What are Subqueries?

**Subqueries**, also known as inner queries or nested queries, are `SELECT` statements embedded within another SQL query. They allow you to break down complex problems, retrieve intermediate results, and filter data dynamically. Subqueries can return a single value, multiple rows, or even operate row-by-row, making them versatile for advanced data manipulation.

In AI/ML, subqueries are essential for tasks like filtering datasets based on derived conditions, comparing values, or preparing hierarchical data for modeling. For freshers, subqueries are a **key interview topic**, testing your ability to think logically and handle multi-step queries! 💡

## 🎯 Why Subqueries Matter for AI/ML Interviews

Subqueries are a **must-know** for AI/ML roles because:

1. **Complex Filtering**: Enable precise data extraction for model training (e.g., selecting users based on aggregated metrics).
2. **Interview Challenges**: Frequently appear in coding tests, requiring you to combine logic and SQL skills.
3. **Data Preparation**: Support feature engineering by computing intermediate results (e.g., averages or counts).
4. **Flexibility**: Work in `WHERE`, `SELECT`, `FROM`, or `HAVING` clauses for diverse use cases.
5. **Universal Applicability**: Supported across MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and more.

Mastering subqueries will set you apart in interviews by showcasing your ability to solve intricate data problems! 🌟

## 🗺️ Subqueries Roadmap

Our Subqueries journey is structured into **leaf nodes**, each exploring a specific type of subquery. Click the links below to dive into detailed theory, coding examples, and interview exercises for each topic! 📚

| Leaf Node | Description | Folder Link |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Single-Row Subqueries** | Subqueries returning one row and one column, used for simple comparisons. | [📂 01 Single-Row Subqueries](./01%20Single-Row%20Subqueries) |
| **Multi-Row Subqueries** | Subqueries returning multiple rows, often used with operators like `IN` or `ANY`. | [📂 02 Multi-Row Subqueries](./02%20Multi-Row%20Subqueries) |
| **Correlated Subqueries** | Subqueries that reference outer query columns, executed row-by-row. | [📂 03 Correlated Subqueries](./03%20Correlated%20Subqueries) |
| **Nested Subqueries** | Subqueries within subqueries for multi-level logic and complex filtering. | [📂 04 Nested Subqueries](./04%20Nested%20Subqueries) |

## 🚀 How to Use This Subqueries Section

1. **Begin with Single-Row Subqueries**: Build confidence with simple subqueries that return one value.
2. **Progress Logically**: Move to Multi-Row, Correlated, and Nested Subqueries for advanced techniques.
3. **Explore Each Folder**: Every leaf node folder contains:
   - **README.md**: In-depth theory and best practices.
   - **Coding**: Hands-on SQL queries to practice.
   - **Interview_Exercises**: Curated problems to ace interviews.
4. **Practice Regularly**: Spend 1-2 hours per leaf node, experimenting with query logic.
5. **Master Interview Favorites**: Focus on Single-Row and Multi-Row Subqueries for fresher interviews, as they’re common in coding tests!

> **Pro Tip**: Break down complex subqueries into smaller steps and test each part—interviewers love seeing clear, logical thinking!

## 💡 Subqueries in AI/ML: Real-World Use Cases

Subqueries shine in AI/ML workflows by enabling sophisticated data manipulation:

- **Dynamic Filtering**: Select records based on aggregates (e.g., `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees)`).
- **Feature Engineering**: Compute derived features (e.g., `SELECT user_id, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE orders.user_id = users.user_id) AS order_count FROM users`).
- **Data Validation**: Identify outliers using comparisons (e.g., `SELECT * FROM predictions WHERE score > (SELECT AVG(score) FROM predictions)`).
- **Hierarchical Analysis**: Filter nested relationships (e.g., `SELECT * FROM products WHERE category_id IN (SELECT id FROM categories WHERE active = 1)`).

Subqueries empower you to prepare clean, targeted data for machine learning models! 🌍

## 📚 Tips for Success

- **Start Simple**: Write basic subqueries before tackling correlated or nested ones.
- **Test Incrementally**: Run subqueries independently to verify results.
- **Understand Performance**: Subqueries can be slower than JOINs; optimize for large datasets.
- **Practice Platforms**: Use LeetCode, HackerRank, or SQLZoo for subquery challenges.
- **Explain Logic**: Be ready to describe how your subquery works in interviews.
