# üîó Foreign Key - Linking Tables Together

## üåü Overview

The **Foreign Key** constraint in SQL enforces **referential integrity** by ensuring that values in a column (or columns) match values in a primary key or unique key of another table. It establishes relationships between tables, critical for relational databases. In AI/ML, foreign keys are used to link datasets, maintain consistency across tables, and ensure valid data for model training.

## üìú Syntax

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column_name datatype,
    ...,
    CONSTRAINT fk_name FOREIGN KEY (column_name)
        REFERENCES parent_table (parent_column)
        [ON DELETE action] [ON UPDATE action]
);
```

- **Basic Example**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE orders (
      order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
      customer_id INT,
      order_date DATE,
      CONSTRAINT fk_customer FOREIGN KEY (customer_id)
          REFERENCES customers (customer_id)
  );
  ```
- **With Actions**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE order_details (
      order_id INT,
      product_id INT,
      CONSTRAINT fk_order FOREIGN KEY (order_id)
          REFERENCES orders (order_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
  );
  ```

## üí° Use Cases in AI/ML

- **Dataset Relationships**: Link training data tables (e.g., `orders.customer_id` to `customers.customer_id`).
- **Data Consistency**: Ensure valid references in feature tables (e.g., `prediction.model_id` to `models.model_id`).
- **Joins for Features**: Enable joins to combine data (e.g., joining `users` and `logins` for user activity features).
- **Cascading Updates**: Maintain consistency during cleanup (e.g., `ON DELETE CASCADE` for dependent records).

## üîë Key Features

- **Referential Integrity**: Ensures foreign key values exist in the referenced table.
- **Action Options**: Supports `ON DELETE`/`ON UPDATE` (e.g., `CASCADE`, `SET NULL`, `RESTRICT`).
- **Multi-Column Keys**: Can reference composite keys for complex relationships.
- **Enforcement**: Prevents orphaned records (e.g., orders without customers).

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- **Reference Stable Keys**: Link to primary keys or unique columns unlikely to change.
- **Use CASCADE Judiciously**: Apply `CASCADE` only when automatic deletion/updates are safe.
- **Index Foreign Keys**: Add indexes on foreign key columns for query performance.
- **Name Constraints**: Use clear names (e.g., `fk_customer`) for easy maintenance.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

- **Invalid References**: Inserting non-existent values (e.g., unmatched `customer_id`) causes errors.
- **Performance Overhead**: Foreign keys add checks, slowing inserts/updates.
- **Complex Cascades**: Misusing `CASCADE` can unintentionally delete critical data.
- **Dependency Issues**: Dropping referenced tables requires dropping foreign keys first.

## üìù Additional Notes

- **Database Variations**:
  - MySQL: Requires `InnoDB` for foreign key support; enforces `RESTRICT` by default.
  - PostgreSQL: Supports `DEFERRABLE` for delayed checks; offers `MATCH FULL/PARTIAL`.
  - SQL Server: Requires exact type match between columns.
- **Performance Tip**: Disable foreign keys temporarily during bulk loads, but re-enable after.
- **Limitations**: Not all databases support all `ON UPDATE`/`ON DELETE` options.
