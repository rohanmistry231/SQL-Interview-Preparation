## 🌟 What are Views?

**Views** in SQL are **virtual tables** created by a stored query, allowing you to access data from one or more tables without modifying the underlying data. Defined using Data Definition Language (DDL), views simplify complex queries, provide security by restricting data access, and present data in a customized format. Unlike physical tables, views don’t store data themselves but dynamically retrieve it when queried.

In AI/ML, views are essential for preparing model inputs, aggregating features, and securing sensitive data in datasets. For freshers, views are a **key interview topic**, often tested in questions about query optimization and data access control! 💡

## 🎯 Why Views Matter for AI/ML Interviews

Views are a **must-have skill** for AI/ML roles because:

1. **Query Simplification**: Transform complex joins or aggregations into reusable, simple queries.
2. **Interview Favorites**: Questions often involve creating views to summarize data or restrict access.
3. **Data Security**: Limit exposure of sensitive columns for compliance in ML pipelines.
4. **Feature Preparation**: Provide clean, aggregated data for model training without altering tables.
5. **Universal Applicability**: Supported across MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and more.

Mastering views will help you write efficient queries and shine in technical interviews! 🌟

## 🗺️ Views Roadmap

Our Views journey is structured into **sub-folders**, each focusing on a specific view-related DDL operation. Click the links below to explore in-depth theory, coding examples, and interview exercises for each topic! 📚

| Sub-Folder | Description | Folder Link |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Create View** | Define new views to simplify queries or secure data. | [📂 01 Create View](./01%20Create%20View) |
| **Alter View** | Modify existing views to update their definitions. | [📂 02 Alter View](./02%20Alter%20View) |
| **Drop View** | Remove views from the database when no longer needed. | [📂 03 Drop View](./03%20Drop%20View) |

## 🚀 How to Use This Views Section

1. **Start with Create View**: Learn to define views, the foundation of virtual tables.
2. **Progress to Alter View**: Master updating views to adapt to changing needs.
3. **Explore Drop View**: Understand how to remove views safely.
4. **Dive into Folders**: Each sub-folder contains:
   - **README.md**: Detailed theory and best practices.
   - **Coding**: Hands-on SQL queries to practice.
   - **Interview_Exercises**: Curated problems to ace interviews.
5. **Practice Regularly**: Spend 1-2 hours per sub-folder, experimenting with view creation.

> **Pro Tip**: Test views with `SELECT * FROM view_name` to verify their output—interviewers value clarity in view design!

## 💡 Views in AI/ML: Real-World Use Cases

Views are powerful in AI/ML workflows:

- **Feature Aggregation**: Create views for model inputs (e.g., `CREATE VIEW user_features AS SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) FROM orders GROUP BY user_id`).
- **Data Security**: Restrict access to sensitive data (e.g., `CREATE VIEW public_users AS SELECT user_id, name FROM users`).
- **Simplified Queries**: Streamline complex joins (e.g., `CREATE VIEW order_summary AS SELECT o.order_id, c.name FROM orders o JOIN customers c`).
- **Experiment Tracking**: Summarize results (e.g., `CREATE VIEW model_metrics AS SELECT model_id, AVG(score) FROM predictions GROUP BY model_id`).
- **Pipeline Optimization**: Provide precomputed data for ML pipelines without duplicating storage.

Views make your data accessible and secure for machine learning success! 🌍

## 📚 Tips for Success

- **Start Simple**: Practice basic views before combining joins or aggregations.
- **Validate Queries**: Test the underlying `SELECT` statement before creating a view.
- **Use Sandbox**: Experiment with views in a test database to avoid impacting production.
- **Practice Platforms**: Try LeetCode, HackerRank, or SQLZoo for view-related challenges.
- **Name Clearly**: Use descriptive view names (e.g., `user_summary`) to reflect purpose.
